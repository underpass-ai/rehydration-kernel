# Rehydration MCP

Installable stdio MCP adapter for Kernel Memory Protocol (KMP).

Current status:

- exposes `kernel_ingest`, `kernel_wake`, `kernel_ask`, `kernel_goto`,
  `kernel_near`, `kernel_rewind`, `kernel_forward`, `kernel_trace`, and
  `kernel_inspect`;
- can serve explicit fixture-backed KMP responses from
  `api/examples/kernel/v1beta1/kmp`;
- can use the live gRPC kernel when `REHYDRATION_KERNEL_GRPC_ENDPOINT` is set;
- live mode calls the typed `KernelMemoryService` gRPC API directly;
- live `kernel_ask` returns a deterministic evidence-derived answer or
  `UNKNOWN`, not a generated answer;
- dimension scope defaults to `current_about`; `abouts` requires a non-empty
  about list; `all_abouts` is explicit and uses the kernel memory about index;
- `kernel_inspect` supports typed detail/link lookup; `include.raw=true` fails
  fast until a typed raw response shape exists;
- temporal `include.raw_refs=true` fails fast until a typed raw reference
  response shape exists.

Run locally:

```bash
REHYDRATION_MCP_BACKEND=fixture cargo run -p rehydration-mcp --locked
```

Install from Git:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/underpass-ai/rehydration-kernel rehydration-mcp --locked
```

Install with the repo helper:

```bash
bash scripts/mcp/install-rehydration-mcp.sh
```

Live gRPC backend:

```bash
REHYDRATION_KERNEL_GRPC_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:50051 cargo run -p rehydration-mcp --locked
```

Public HTTPS endpoint:

```bash
REHYDRATION_KERNEL_GRPC_ENDPOINT=https://rehydration-kernel.underpassai.com cargo run -p rehydration-mcp --locked
```

The server reads newline-delimited JSON-RPC requests from stdin and writes
newline-delimited JSON-RPC responses to stdout.
The executable is fail-fast by default: set `REHYDRATION_KERNEL_GRPC_ENDPOINT`
for live gRPC mode, or set `REHYDRATION_MCP_BACKEND=fixture` explicitly for
fixture mode.

Minimal smoke request:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}
```

Repo smoke script:

```bash
REHYDRATION_MCP_BACKEND=fixture REHYDRATION_MCP_BIN=rehydration-mcp \
  bash scripts/mcp/kmp-stdio-smoke.sh
```

Smoke an installed binary:

```bash
REHYDRATION_KERNEL_GRPC_ENDPOINT=https://rehydration-kernel.underpassai.com \
REHYDRATION_MCP_BIN=rehydration-mcp \
  bash scripts/mcp/kmp-stdio-smoke.sh
```

Tool call example:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"kernel_ask","arguments":{"about":"question:830ce83f","question":"Where did Rachel move after her recent relocation?","answer_policy":"evidence_or_unknown"}}}
```
