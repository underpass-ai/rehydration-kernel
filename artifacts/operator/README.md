# Operator Local Artifacts

This directory documents local Operator benchmark artifact caches.

Large data should stay outside the repository tree so normal Git operations,
search, and editor indexing stay fast. Keep only this README and the local
`.gitignore` tracked here.

Current local cache:

- `../rehydration-kernel-artifacts/operator/p111-pageinfo-221-20260512/`:
  MemoryArena P1.11 221-task run, remote audit smoke, regenerated Operator
  trajectories, SFT split, and policy eval outputs.
- `../rehydration-kernel-artifacts/operator/longmemeval-valid-20260512/`:
  preserved LongMemEval Balanced60/100/MS30 smart-writer artifacts, exported
  LongMemEval Operator trajectories, mixed MemoryArena+LongMemEval SFT data,
  no-gold audit report, downloaded `longmemeval_s_cleaned.json`, and the
  500-item full-history smoke artifacts.
