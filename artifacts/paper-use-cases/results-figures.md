# Paper Use Case Figures

Source: `artifacts/paper-use-cases/summary.json`

Legend:
- `full`: full explanatory relations with detail
- `no-detail`: full explanatory relations without detail
- `structural`: structural-only relations with detail
- `detail-only`: structural relations with explanation injected into node detail
- `*@96`: same relation/detail mode rendered with a 96-token budget
- `*-meso`: same variant over a denser noisy graph
