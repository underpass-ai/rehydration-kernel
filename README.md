# Rehydration Kernel

Node-centric context rehydration for agentic systems.

## What This Repo Is

`rehydration-kernel` is a generic context engine built around four public
concepts:

- root node
- neighbor nodes
- relationships
- extended node detail

The kernel does not own product-specific nouns. Integrating products are
expected to map their own domain language to this graph model at the edge.
The kernel also assumes its own infrastructure dependencies are present:
Neo4j, Valkey, and NATS are required runtime components, not optional features.

## Current Status

This repo is functionally complete for the kernel-owned migration scope.
Known limitations on reserved query fields are documented in
[`docs/beta-status.md`](./docs/beta-status.md).

What is already in place:

- graph-native domain and application layers
- split Neo4j, Valkey, NATS, and gRPC adapters
- frozen node-centric gRPC and async contracts
- contract CI with `buf breaking`, AsyncAPI checks, and boundary naming policy
- container-backed integration tests
- full kernel journey end-to-end coverage:
  - projection -> query -> compatibility -> command -> admin
  - full TLS variant across gRPC, NATS, Valkey, and Neo4j in the test harness
- agentic end-to-end proofs:
  - pull-driven runtime flow against a narrow runtime contract shape
  - event-driven runtime trigger flow
- cluster-verifiable starship journey demo for a production-like graph case
- runtime integration reference docs and runnable client example

What is intentionally out of scope for this repo:

- `swe-ai-fleet` legacy noun modeling
- `planning.*` or `orchestration.*` consumers
- product-side shadow mode implementation
- rollout and rollback logic

Non-negotiable rules: DDD first, hexagonal boundaries, one concept per file,
one use case per file.

**Infrastructure stack:**

- **Neo4j** — graph state: nodes, relationships, traversal
- **Valkey** — snapshots, node detail, event store (RESP protocol)
- **NATS JetStream** — projection events, command event store (optimistic concurrency)
- **gRPC + mTLS** — all external and internal boundaries TLS-encrypted
- **OpenTelemetry** — traces and metrics via OTLP (7 instruments)
- **Helm chart** — production-ready with optional NATS/Valkey sidecars, TLS config, OTel endpoint
- **cl100k_base** — BPE tokenization (tiktoken-rs) for accurate token budgets
- **Salience ordering** — causal > motivational > evidential > constraint > procedural > structural

## Contracts

Primary public artifacts:

- gRPC proto:
  - [`api/proto/underpass/rehydration/kernel/v1beta1`](./api/proto/underpass/rehydration/kernel/v1beta1)
- async contract:
  - [`api/asyncapi/context-projection.v1beta1.yaml`](./api/asyncapi/context-projection.v1beta1.yaml)
- contract examples:
  - [`api/examples/README.md`](./api/examples/README.md)
- runtime integration reference:
  - [`docs/migration/kernel-runtime-integration-reference.md`](./docs/migration/kernel-runtime-integration-reference.md)

Historical migration and handoff docs live under [`docs/migration`](./docs/migration).
Many of them are historical after the `v1beta1` cut and compatibility removal.
Use the active integration references first, and treat older migration notes as
review-required unless they explicitly say otherwise.

## Benchmark

LLM-as-judge evaluation across 18 configurations (3 scales × 2 domains × 3
relation mixes). Each cell is `TaskOK + RestartOK + ReasonPreserved` out of 3.

### Key finding: explanatory context closes the model capability gap

| Model | Budget | Explanatory | Structural | Gap |
|-------|:------:|:----------:|:----------:|:---:|
| GPT-5.4 (frontier) | 4096 | 17/18 (94%) | 11/18 (61%) | 33pp |
| Claude Opus 4 (frontier) | 4096 | 15/18 (83%) | 10/18 (56%) | 27pp |
| Qwen3-8B (local 8B) | 4096 | 18/18 (100%) | 9/18 (50%) | 50pp |
| Qwen3-8B (local 8B) | **512** | **15/18 (83%)** | 8/18 (44%) | 39pp |

With generous budget (4096 tokens), Qwen3-8B achieves 100% on explanatory
because the rationale text is present verbatim in the rendered context — the
model extracts rather than reasons. Under token pressure (512 tokens, forcing
68-85% truncation on meso/stress graphs), accuracy drops to 83% — still
matching Claude Opus 4 at full budget.

The practical implication: **a local 8B model with the kernel's explanatory
context under token pressure matches a frontier model at full budget.**
Structural-only accuracy degrades consistently across all models (50-61%),
confirming that the kernel's explanatory metadata is the dominant signal.

### Full results by configuration

**GPT-5.4 inference + Claude Opus 4 judge (budget 4096):**

| Config | Explanatory | Structural | Mixed |
|--------|:-----------:|:----------:|:-----:|
| micro-ops | 3/3 | 2/3 | 3/3 |
| micro-debug | 3/3 | 2/3 | 3/3 |
| meso-ops | 2/3 | 2/3 | 3/3 |
| meso-debug | 3/3 | 2/3 | 3/3 |
| stress-ops | 3/3 | 2/3 | 3/3 |
| stress-debug | 3/3 | 1/3 | 3/3 |

**Qwen3-8B vLLM + Claude Opus 4 judge (budget 4096):**

| Config | Explanatory | Structural | Mixed |
|--------|:-----------:|:----------:|:-----:|
| micro-ops | 3/3 | 2/3 | 3/3 |
| micro-debug | 3/3 | 0/3 | 3/3 |
| meso-ops | 3/3 | 2/3 | 3/3 |
| meso-debug | 3/3 | 2/3 | 3/3 |
| stress-ops | 3/3 | 2/3 | 3/3 |
| stress-debug | 3/3 | 1/3 | 3/3 |

**Qwen3-8B vLLM + Claude Opus 4 judge (budget 512 — truncated):**

| Config | Explanatory | Structural | Mixed | Tokens |
|--------|:-----------:|:----------:|:-----:|:------:|
| micro-ops | 3/3 | 1/3 | 3/3 | 354 |
| micro-debug | 3/3 | 1/3 | 3/3 | 340 |
| meso-ops | 3/3 | 2/3 | 3/3 | ~490 |
| meso-debug | 3/3 | 2/3 | 2/3 | ~494 |
| stress-ops | 0/3 | 2/3 | 3/3 | ~506 |
| stress-debug | 3/3 | 0/3 | 3/3 | ~492 |

Under 512-token budget, meso explanatory holds at 3/3 (68% truncated) while
stress-ops-explanatory drops to 0/3 (85% truncated, critical context lost).
The kernel's salience ordering (causal > motivational > evidential > structural)
preserves the most important relationships under pressure.

Scales: micro (4 nodes), meso (21 nodes), stress (49 nodes).
Domains: operations (incident response), software debugging (hypothesis/fix cycle).

Evaluation prompts are externalized to
[`crates/rehydration-testkit/resources/llm_prompts.yaml`](./crates/rehydration-testkit/resources/llm_prompts.yaml)
and can be overridden at runtime via `LLM_PROMPTS_PATH`.

## Paper Artifact

The repository also contains an artifact-backed paper draft on explanatory
graph context rehydration for agentic systems.

Current paper materials:

- submission draft:
  [`docs/PAPER_SUBMISSION_DRAFT.md`](./docs/PAPER_SUBMISSION_DRAFT.md)
- ACL package index:
  [`docs/paper/README.md`](./docs/paper/README.md)
- ACL LaTeX sources:
  [`docs/paper/acl/`](./docs/paper/acl/) (build locally with `pdflatex`)
- paper-use-case artifact summary:
  [`artifacts/paper-use-cases/summary.json`](./artifacts/paper-use-cases/summary.json)
- paper-use-case rendered report:
  [`artifacts/paper-use-cases/results.md`](./artifacts/paper-use-cases/results.md)

The current manuscript evaluates four use cases:

- failure diagnosis with rehydration-point recovery
- why a task was implemented in a particular way
- interrupted handoff with resumable execution
- constraint-preserving retrieval under token pressure

## Quickstart

Toolchain:

- Rust `1.90.0`, pinned in [`rust-toolchain.toml`](./rust-toolchain.toml)

Core checks:

```bash
cargo fmt --all
cargo check --workspace
cargo test --workspace
```

Repository gate:

```bash
bash scripts/ci/quality-gate.sh
```

Focused contract gate:

```bash
bash scripts/ci/contract-gate.sh
```

Container-backed integration targets:

```bash
bash scripts/ci/integration-valkey.sh
bash scripts/ci/integration-neo4j.sh
bash scripts/ci/integration-agentic-context.sh
bash scripts/ci/integration-agentic-event-context.sh
bash scripts/ci/integration-kernel-full-journey.sh
bash scripts/ci/integration-kernel-full-journey-tls.sh
```

For deployed kernels, the generic projection runtime persists its own state in
Valkey through `REHYDRATION_RUNTIME_STATE_URI`.

Container image build check:

```bash
bash scripts/ci/container-image.sh
```

The script uses `docker` when available and falls back to `podman`. Override
with `CONTAINER_RUNTIME=docker` or `CONTAINER_RUNTIME=podman` if you need to
force one runtime.

Helm chart lint:

```bash
bash scripts/ci/helm-lint.sh
```

## Public Readiness Notes

If you are integrating another product with this kernel, start here:

- [`docs/migration/kernel-runtime-integration-reference.md`](./docs/migration/kernel-runtime-integration-reference.md)
- [`docs/migration/kernel-repo-closeout.md`](./docs/migration/kernel-repo-closeout.md)

If you are integrating `swe-ai-fleet`, the handoff docs are:

- [`docs/migration/swe-ai-fleet-node-centric-integration-strategy.md`](./docs/migration/swe-ai-fleet-node-centric-integration-strategy.md)
- [`docs/migration/swe-ai-fleet-shadow-mode-spec.md`](./docs/migration/swe-ai-fleet-shadow-mode-spec.md)
- [`docs/migration/swe-ai-fleet-integration-checklist.md`](./docs/migration/swe-ai-fleet-integration-checklist.md)

## Runtime And Deployment Ecosystem

This repo owns the kernel code, contracts, and integration proofs.

Operational packaging may live in sibling repos that consume the kernel. In the
current ecosystem that includes a sibling runtime capable of:

- publishing container artifacts to GitHub Container Registry
- running under Docker Compose
- running on Kubernetes through Helm

That deployment packaging is intentionally kept outside the kernel repo when it
belongs to the runtime or product layer rather than to the kernel itself.

See:

- [`docs/operations/README.md`](./docs/operations/README.md)
- [`docs/operations/deployment-boundary.md`](./docs/operations/deployment-boundary.md)
- [`docs/operations/container-image.md`](./docs/operations/container-image.md)

## Standalone Container Image

The kernel now owns a standalone OCI image intended for external download and
evaluation.

Public location:

- `ghcr.io/underpass-ai/rehydration-kernel`

Typical pull:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/underpass-ai/rehydration-kernel:latest
```

See [`docs/operations/container-image.md`](./docs/operations/container-image.md)
for environment variables, tags, and usage.

Helm chart:

- source chart: [`charts/rehydration-kernel`](./charts/rehydration-kernel)
- OCI location: `oci://ghcr.io/underpass-ai/charts/rehydration-kernel`

The default chart values are intentionally secure:

- no implicit `latest` image tag
- no inline backend URIs by default
- production-style installs should use `image.digest` or a pinned tag plus `secrets.existingSecret`
- optional `ingress.enabled` can expose the gRPC service through a controller-managed ingress
- optional `neo4jTls.*` can mount a custom Neo4j CA for secure `graphUri` values

The sibling-runtime deployment profiles are:

- [`charts/rehydration-kernel/values.underpass-runtime.yaml`](./charts/rehydration-kernel/values.underpass-runtime.yaml) for the current cluster wiring, including the NGINX gRPC ingress host `rehydration-kernel.underpassai.com`
- [`charts/rehydration-kernel/values.underpass-runtime.secure.example.yaml`](./charts/rehydration-kernel/values.underpass-runtime.secure.example.yaml) for the staged Neo4j TLS target once the shared graph service publishes a CA-backed TLS endpoint

For local evaluation only, use [`values.dev.yaml`](./charts/rehydration-kernel/values.dev.yaml).
