# Underpass Kernel

> Part of [Underpass AI](https://underpassai.com) — memory and execution infrastructure for reliable AI agents.

Kernel Memory Protocol for navigable, temporal, multidimensional AI agent
memory.

**New here?** Start with the [Usage Guide](./docs/usage-guide.md) — 3 steps
to give your AI agent graph-aware context with sequence diagrams and examples.

## What This Repo Is

Underpass Kernel implements Kernel Memory Protocol (KMP): an API-first memory
layer for agents, tools, and humans that need to query, traverse, inspect, and
audit process memory.

The kernel models memory around six ideas:

- **About scopes** — every memory belongs to the case, incident, task, user, or
  process it is about.
- **Dimensions** — one about can contain several dimensions: agent, session,
  attempt, subsystem, phase, artifact, or any domain-specific axis.
- **Temporal movement** — memory can be read as it was known at a moment, moved
  forward or backward, or traversed around nearby evidence.
- **Typed relations** — edges carry semantic class, relation type, rationale,
  evidence, and provenance instead of being anonymous links.
- **Inspectable evidence** — clients can ask for context, paths, nearby memory,
  node detail, and relation proof without reading raw transcripts.
- **Observable execution** — writes, projections, traces, scopes, relation
  quality, and tool behavior are measurable and auditable.

KMP is exposed through the typed `KernelMemoryService` gRPC API. MCP is an
adapter over the same semantics so LLMs can operate memory tools without owning
the memory model.

**What the kernel is NOT:**

- Not an LLM — it validates, stores, traverses, and renders memory.
- Not a benchmark solver — readers and plugins interpret recovered evidence.
- Not hidden agent state — memory is queryable through stable APIs.
- Not a vector database replacement — retrieval is graph/temporal/proof oriented.
- Not tied to one model — GPT, Claude, Qwen, Gemma, local models, and humans can
  all use the same protocol.

> **Note on "Operator".** You may see *Operator* mentioned around the benchmarks.
> **Operator is not KMP.** KMP (this kernel) is designed to be easy to use by **people and
> agents** — hence its **MCP/API duality** — and would exist, unchanged, with no Operator at
> all. **Operator is a separate, external project — not part of this kernel — and it is
> benchmark-only.** It exists solely because memory benchmarks (LongMemEval) mandate gpt‑4o,
> which operates the KMP write API poorly; Operator is a small specialist that covers that one
> gap. It is **not** a production layer and is **never** placed above a frontier model — any
> capable model operates KMP directly through MCP. Full explanation:
> **[docs/operator.md](./docs/operator.md)**.

## Why This Matters

Agents do not only need larger prompts. They need memory that can be navigated.

For real agentic work, useful questions look like this:

- What was known when this decision was made?
- Which agent, session, or attempt introduced this assumption?
- What changed later?
- Which relation explains why one step followed another?
- Which path failed, and which path became the final answer?
- Can a human inspect the same evidence without reading the raw transcript?

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Agent / LLM / Human tool] -- gRPC / MCP --> K[Underpass Kernel<br/>KMP]
    K -. context / trace / inspect .-> A

    K --> GP[(Graph persistence)]
    K --> KV[(Key-value persistence)]
    K --> ES[(Event persistence)]

    K -. metrics / logs / traces .-> O[Observability]
```

The current deployment adapters use Neo4j for graph persistence, Valkey for
key-value persistence, and NATS JetStream for event persistence/streaming. The
architecture keeps those choices behind ports so the protocol semantics can
move toward backend-independent conformance over time.

Current operator-model work is tracked in
[`docs/product/kernel-tool-operator-model-plan.md`](./docs/product/kernel-tool-operator-model-plan.md).
The Hugging Face publication gate and draft model/dataset cards are tracked in
[`docs/product/kernel-tool-operator-publication-plan.md`](./docs/product/kernel-tool-operator-publication-plan.md).

### KMP is operated directly through MCP

KMP is exposed through MCP as the **same tool surface an agent uses** (`kernel_wake`,
`kernel_ask`, `kernel_near`, `kernel_trace`, `kernel_inspect`, `kernel_write_memory`).
**Any capable frontier model — Claude Opus, GPT-5.x, etc. — operates KMP directly. There is
no required intermediary, and a frontier model would not route through a smaller one.**

```mermaid
graph LR

    A -->|"kernel_wake / ask / near / trace / inspect / write_memory"| MCP
    MCP --> K
    K -->|"evidence · refs · proof · or fail-fast"| A
```

> **Operator — a small API-use specialist (research / benchmark thread).** A separate
> external project (not part of this kernel) trains a *small* model (0.5B) to use this exact
> MCP surface. It exists only to
> cover what **gpt-4o — used here solely because the benchmark's official judge requires it,
> not by choice — does *not* do well: operating KMP**. It tests one specific claim:
> **a small model trained specifically to use an API can match a 4o / 4o-mini-class model at
> using it.** It is **not** compared to or placed above frontier
> models (Claude Opus, GPT-5.x), which operate KMP directly and would never route through it.
> Honest claim: *it predicts bounded KMP actions from a visible memory state, under a strict
> contract and real MCP replay against the kernel.* See

## Current Status

v1beta1 — production-ready RPCs, known limitations documented in
[`docs/beta-status.md`](./docs/beta-status.md).

What is in place:

- Hexagonal domain/application/adapter/transport layers
- gRPC + async (NATS) contracts with CI protection (`buf breaking`, AsyncAPI checks)
- Typed `KernelMemoryService` for Kernel Memory Protocol moves: ingest, wake,
  ask, goto, near, rewind, forward, trace, and inspect
- Installable stdio MCP adapter backed by the typed `KernelMemoryService`
- TLS on infrastructure boundaries, with mTLS on gRPC, Valkey, NATS, and OTel
  where configured. Neo4j server TLS is supported; Neo4j client-certificate
  auth is still limited by the Rust driver stack
- Workspace unit tests + container-backed integration tests +
  [LLM-as-judge E2E benchmark](./docs/testing.md#benchmark-tests-llm-as-judge)
  ([methodology](./docs/research/benchmark-methodology-v1.md))
- 5 E2E Helm tests via `helm test`, including the typed
  `KernelMemoryService` lifecycle
- Multi-resolution rendering (L0/L1/L2) with auto mode selection
- Quality metrics with OTel + Loki observability
- Helm chart with optional infrastructure sidecars and E2E test hooks

What is out of scope:

- Product-specific domain nouns (the kernel is generic)
- Product-side integration adapters, shadow mode, or rollout logic
- Authorization backend (scope validation is set-comparison only)

## Quickstart

```bash
# Toolchain: Rust 1.90.0 (pinned in rust-toolchain.toml)
cargo test --workspace               # workspace unit tests, no infra needed
bash scripts/ci/quality-gate.sh      # format + clippy + contract + tests
```

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/underpass-ai/rehydration-kernel:latest
```

`latest` is for a quick trial; pin a `sha-<short-commit>` or `v*` tag (or a digest) in production.

Full guides: [usage](./docs/usage-guide.md) | [testing](./docs/testing.md) |
[container image](./docs/operations/container-image.md) |
[Helm deploy](./docs/operations/kubernetes-deploy.md)

### Verify a deployment

```bash
# Enable E2E tests and run against live cluster
helm upgrade rehydration-kernel charts/rehydration-kernel \
  --reuse-values --set e2e.enabled=true

helm test rehydration-kernel --timeout 5m
# Helm hooks cover transport/mTLS smoke plus the typed KernelMemoryService lifecycle.
```

Tests require the `e2e-client-tls` secret (same CA used by the kernel).
See `charts/rehydration-kernel/values.yaml` for full E2E configuration.

## Architecture

The kernel uses **CQRS with Event Sourcing**:

- **Command side**: `UpdateContext` validates, appends events to an append-only
  store (NATS JetStream or Valkey), with optimistic concurrency (revision check)
  and idempotency key outcome recording
- **Projection**: NATS JetStream durable consumers materialize events into the
  read model (Neo4j for graph, Valkey for detail). Explicit ack, at-least-once delivery
- **Query side**: `GetContext`, `GetContextPath`, `RehydrateSession` read from
  the materialized projections and render token-budgeted text

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Command
        UC[UpdateContext] --> ES[(Event Store<br/>NATS JetStream)]
    end

    subgraph Projection
        ES -. durable consumers .-> PR[Projection Runtime]
        PR --> N4[(Neo4j<br/>graph)]
        PR --> VK[(Valkey<br/>detail)]
    end

    subgraph Query
        GC[GetContext] --> N4
        GC --> VK
        GC -. rendered context .-> A[Agent]
    end
```

> Infrastructure connections support TLS where the backend supports it. gRPC,
> Valkey, NATS, and OTLP can run with mTLS through Helm/env configuration.
> Neo4j server TLS is supported; Neo4j client-certificate auth remains partial.

DDD, hexagonal boundaries, one concept per file, one use case per file.

**Infrastructure:**

- **Neo4j** — graph read model (nodes, relationships, traversal)
- **Valkey** — node detail, snapshots, projection state (dedup + checkpoints)
- **NATS JetStream** — event store (append-only, file-backed) + projection event bus
- **gRPC + TLS/mTLS** — supports plaintext, server TLS, mutual TLS (default: plaintext)
- **cl100k_base** — BPE tokenization (tiktoken-rs) for accurate token budgets
- **OpenTelemetry + Loki** — OTLP metric instruments + structured JSON logs. See [observability](./docs/observability.md)
- **Helm chart** — optional Neo4j/NATS/Valkey/Loki/Grafana/OTel Collector sidecars

## Multi-Resolution Rendering

Every render produces three tiers simultaneously. Consumers pick the level
they need — no separate API calls, no re-rendering.

```
  L0 Summary          ~100 tokens    objective, status, blocker, next action
  L1 Causal Spine     ~500 tokens    root → focus → causal/motivational/evidential chain
  L2 Evidence Pack    remaining      structural relations, neighbors, extended details
```

| Use case | Tier | Why |
|:---------|:----:|:----|
| Status check / quick triage | L0 | Fits in a system prompt alongside other tools |
| Failure diagnosis / handoff resume | L0 + L1 | Causal chain is the dominant signal |
| Deep analysis / full audit | L0 + L1 + L2 | Everything the graph knows, salience-ordered |

**RehydrationMode** auto-selects strategy based on token pressure, endpoint
type, focus path, and causal density:

- **ReasonPreserving** (default) — all tiers populated, full signal
- **ResumeFocused** — prunes distractor branches, keeps only the causal spine.
  Under 8x budget reduction (4096 → 512): -3pp task accuracy, +17pp recovery

Control via `max_tier` on the request or let the kernel decide with `rehydration_mode = AUTO`.

## Security

Infrastructure boundaries support TLS where the backend supports it. The gRPC
transport supports mTLS; Valkey, NATS, and OTLP can also use client
certificates through Helm/env configuration. Neo4j currently supports server
TLS/CA trust in the kernel chart; Neo4j client-certificate auth is pending
driver support.

| Boundary | Transport | Authentication |
|:---------|:----------|:---------------|
| Callers → Kernel | gRPC with server TLS or **mTLS** | Client certificate validation against trusted CA |
| Kernel → Neo4j | `bolt+s://` / `neo4j+s://` with CA pinning | URI-embedded credentials via K8s secrets |
| Kernel → Valkey | `rediss://` with **mTLS** | Client certificate + key from secrets |
| Kernel → NATS | TLS with CA pinning, `tls_first` | Client certificate or NATS credentials |
| Kernel → OTel Collector | gRPC with optional **mTLS** via env vars | `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_CA_PATH`, `_CERT_PATH`, `_KEY_PATH` |

Commands are protected by **idempotency key outcome recording** and **optimistic concurrency**
(revision + content hash). Credentials are never inlined — always mounted from
Kubernetes secrets.

## Benchmark

432 LLM-as-judge evaluations across two independent judges (GPT-5.4 and
Claude Sonnet 4.6), three graph scales, four noise conditions, and three
random seeds. Null hypothesis rejected at 95% confidence.

| Context type | Task | Recovery | Reason | Gap vs structural |
|:-------------|:----:|:--------:|:------:|:-----------------:|
| **Explanatory** (kernel) | **72%** [56%, 84%] | **75%** [59%, 86%] | **72%** [56%, 84%] | **+69pp** |
| Structural (edges only) | 3% [0%, 14%] | 0% [0%, 10%] | 0% [0%, 10%] | baseline |
| **Mixed** (both) | **92%** [78%, 97%] | **81%** [65%, 90%] | **89%** [75%, 96%] | **+89pp** |

> Agent: Qwen3-8B with chain-of-thought (local). Judge: GPT-5.4. Wilson 95% CI in brackets.
> Cross-judge validated: Sonnet 4.6 produces the same gap (+67pp).
> Synthetic graphs, not production workloads.

## Running E2E tests

Run `./scripts/e2e/regen.sh` before live E2E, replay validation, or infra-touching checks. It automates the version preflight in [docs/operations/preflight.md](docs/operations/preflight.md) and reports stale binaries, drifted Helm/Kubernetes state, missing certs, or endpoint/model mismatches before expensive tests run.

Example:

```bash
./scripts/e2e/regen.sh --verbose
```

Expected output uses `[OK]`, `[WARN]`, and `[FAIL]` lines and ends with an `N/M checks passed` summary.
