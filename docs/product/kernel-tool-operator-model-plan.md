# Kernel Tool Operator Model Plan

Status: P1.1-P1.10 are implemented: trajectory export, offline evaluation,
deterministic and generalist baselines, ref-safe datasets, SFT LoRA training,
explicit holdout validation, raw-ref de-anonymization, and live MCP replay.
The row-split LoRA run remains only a smoke test. The preferred result is now
the V6 explicit holdout20 run: grouped task split with tasks 80-99 reserved for
eval, synthetic model-facing refs, zero dropped non-visible target refs,
structural writer candidate details, and evaluation against anonymized model
trajectories. It reached 1.000 exact action accuracy, 1.000 primary-ref
accuracy, and zero invalid or unbounded actions on 1,124 held-out decisions.
The same 1,124 predictions were de-anonymized and replayed through the public
TLS MCP/gRPC endpoint: 976 executed tool calls, 148 stop actions, 0 MCP
failures, 0 missing expected refs, and 7m18.7s elapsed. The top active
requirement is now P1.11.0: bounded pagination, progress, and resume semantics
for large KMP traversal, remote audit, and replay. No publication or
model-release claim should move forward until that gate is clean.

Date: 2026-05-12.

## Goal

Build a small specialist model that operates the Kernel Memory Protocol tools
efficiently. The model is not the kernel, not the reader, and not the memory
reasoner. It is a tool operator that decides which bounded KMP/MCP move to call
next, with which arguments, and when to stop.

The first useful outcome is not model training. The first useful outcome is a
clean trajectory dataset and evaluator that make tool-use quality measurable.

## Boundary

The operator model may:

- choose one KMP/MCP tool call at a time;
- choose scoped, bounded arguments;
- decide whether to continue, inspect, trace, move temporally, or stop;
- propose `kernel_write_memory` relations only when the relation cites evidence
  observed through previous kernel reads.

The operator model must not:

- bypass the public KMP/MCP/gRPC contract;
- become a hidden memory API;
- invent refs, evidence, relations, dimensions, or about scopes;
- request unbounded histories by default;
- own answer semantics for benchmark-specific tasks;
- become a dependency of kernel core.

Kernel responsibilities remain deterministic:

- traversal;
- proof;
- validation;
- fail-fast errors;
- audit;
- persistence;
- projection.

## Tools In Scope

Read/navigation tools:

- `kernel_ask`
- `kernel_near`
- `kernel_trace`
- `kernel_inspect`
- `kernel_goto`
- `kernel_rewind`
- `kernel_forward`

Write tool:

- `kernel_write_memory`

Write mode is a separate policy mode. The first operator slice should focus on
read/navigation trajectories, then add writer relation trajectories after the
read loop is measurable.

## Why This Is P1

The current MemoryArena and MCP runs show that the kernel can expose useful
memory, but generalist LLM tool use is inconsistent:

- it may overuse broad traversal;
- it may not choose the cheapest next move;
- it may stop late or stop with the wrong candidate;
- it may need more context than a kernel-native operator should need;
- its reasoning is hard to compare unless tool trajectories are normalized.

A small model can be viable because the task surface is narrow:

- state is structured;
- available actions are finite;
- valid arguments are constrained;
- success is directly measurable from refs, scopes, leaks, and stop decisions.

## Required Contract Before Training

Do not start model training until these are true:

- Top 1: `near`, `trace`, `goto`, `rewind`, `forward`, remote audit, and live
  replay expose bounded pagination/progress/resume behavior consistently
  through gRPC/KMP and MCP.
- MCP tool schemas are stable enough to serialize into the training prompt.
- Tool errors are fail-fast and explicit enough to be useful training labels.
- Raw logs are redacted: no API keys, credentials, private raw memory, or
  unbounded prompt dumps.
- Successful and failed trajectories can be separated deterministically.

Training on broken traces without labels is prohibited. Failed trajectories are
useful as hard negatives only after the failure reason is classified.

## Trajectory Schema

Each training/evaluation item should be one decision step, not one whole
benchmark task.

Minimal shape:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "kernel-operator-trajectory-v1",
  "run_id": "memoryarena-smart-writer-paged-50tasks-20260508-0009",
  "task_family": "memoryarena.progressive_search",
  "mode": "read",
  "about": "memoryarena:run:...",
  "step_index": 4,
  "goal": "Find the next bounded evidence move for the current question.",
  "visible_state": {
    "current_ref": "memoryarena:...:subtask:9:answer",
    "known_refs": ["..."],
    "last_tool": "kernel_near",
    "last_observed_refs": ["..."],
    "remaining_budget": {
      "tool_calls": 4,
      "context_chars": 12000
    }
  },
  "allowed_tools": [
    "kernel_near",
    "kernel_trace",
    "kernel_inspect",
    "kernel_goto",
    "kernel_rewind",
    "kernel_forward",
    "kernel_ask"
  ],
  "target_action": {
    "type": "tool_call",
    "tool": "kernel_inspect",
    "arguments": {
      "about": "memoryarena:run:...",
      "ref": "memoryarena:...:subtask:9:answer",
      "include": {
        "details": true,
        "relationships": true,
        "raw": false
      }
    }
  },
  "observed_outcome": {
    "success": true,
    "observed_refs": ["..."],
    "elapsed_ms": 46
  },
  "quality": {
    "known_at_clean": true,
    "future_answer_leak": false,
    "invalid_tool_call": false,
    "bounded": true,
    "stop_correct": null
  }
}
```

Stop action shape:

```json
{
  "target_action": {
    "type": "stop",
    "answer_policy": "evidence_or_unknown",
    "final_refs": ["..."],
    "reason": "sufficient_evidence"
  }
}
```

The dataset should preserve the raw tool result path separately for audit, but
the model-facing item should be compact and redacted.

## Initial Data Sources

Use already audited runs first:

- MemoryArena 100-task smart-writer run:
  `/tmp/memoryarena-smart-writer-paged-100tasks-20260508-1407-run`
- MemoryArena 100-task stderr/log digest:
  `/tmp/memoryarena-smart-writer-paged-100tasks-20260508-1407.stderr`
- MemoryArena 100-task scorecard:
  `/tmp/memoryarena-smart-writer-paged-100tasks-20260508-1407-scorecard`
- MemoryArena 100-task audit:
  `/tmp/memoryarena-smart-writer-paged-100tasks-20260508-1407-audit.json`
- MemoryArena 50-task smart-writer run:
  `/tmp/memoryarena-smart-writer-paged-50tasks-20260508-0009-run`
- MemoryArena 50-task stderr/log digest:
  `/tmp/memoryarena-smart-writer-paged-50tasks-20260508-0009.stderr`
- MemoryArena 50-task scorecard:
  `/tmp/memoryarena-smart-writer-paged-50tasks-20260508-0009-scorecard`
- MemoryArena prepared 221-task artifacts:
  `/tmp/memoryarena-progressive-221-cost-estimate-artifacts`
- Live MCP story demo docs:
  `docs/research/kernel-memory-story-demo-2026-05-05.md`
- Live mobile incident MCP demo docs:
  `docs/research/mobile-login-resolution-replay-demo-2026-05-05.md`

The 100-task MemoryArena run is the best first corpus because it includes real
MCP navigation, smart-writer read-before-write decisions, relation quality
metrics, known-at checks, bounded trace proofs, and three final reader failures
where evidence recall was complete. Those failures prove the operator must not
be evaluated only by final answer correctness.

## P1 Work Packages

### P1.1 Trajectory Exporter

Add a testkit exporter that converts existing runner logs and artifacts into
`kernel-operator-trajectory-v1`.

Proposed binary:

```text
kernel_operator_trajectory_export
```

Implemented binary:

```text
cargo run -p rehydration-testkit --bin kernel_operator_trajectory_export -- \
  --run <memoryarena-run-dir> \
  --output <output-dir> \
  [--include-writer-reads] \
  [--expected-run-id <id>] \
  [--force]
```

Inputs:

- MemoryArena runner output directory;
- MemoryArena scorecard directory;
- optional stderr JSONL log with MCP read/write events;
- optional run id filter;
- optional task id filter.

Outputs:

- `trajectories.jsonl`;
- `summary.json`;
- `failures.jsonl`;
- `redaction_report.json`.

Exit criteria:

- [x] exporter is deterministic;
- [x] exporter fails fast on mixed runs;
- [x] no secret-looking values are emitted;
- [x] every target tool call has bounded arguments;
- [x] failed and successful steps are labelled separately.

Implemented outputs:

- `trajectories.jsonl`
- `summary.json`
- `failures.jsonl`
- `redaction_report.json`

The model-facing trajectory intentionally excludes benchmark gold answers,
`ask_answer`, raw `ask_content`, API keys, credentials, and raw prompt dumps.
Each item is a single decision step:

```text
visible_state -> target_action
```

The first exported action space is read/navigation:

- `kernel_near`
- `kernel_inspect`
- `kernel_trace`
- `stop`

`--include-writer-reads` additionally exports read-before-write tool calls from
the smart writer as `write_context_read` mode, but it does not yet train the
model to propose `kernel_write_memory` relations.

Real export checks:

| Source run | Mode | Trajectories | Tool calls | Stops | Failures | Redaction findings |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| MemoryArena 50-task smart-writer run | read | 1,426 | 1,057 | 369 | 0 | 0 |
| MemoryArena 50-task smart-writer run | read + writer reads | 2,802 | 2,433 | 369 | 0 | 0 |
| MemoryArena 100-task smart-writer run | read | 2,912 | 2,159 | 753 | 0 | 0 |
| MemoryArena 100-task smart-writer run | read + writer reads with candidates | 5,724 | 4,971 | 753 | 0 | 0 |

The first 100-task read-only export produced:

```text
kernel_near    753
kernel_inspect 753
kernel_trace   653
stop           753
```

This gives enough clean data to implement P1.2 without touching kernel core.

### P1.2 Operator Evaluator

Add an offline evaluator that scores a predicted tool action against the
recorded target action and final trajectory quality.

Implemented binary:

```text
cargo run -p rehydration-testkit --bin kernel_operator_policy_eval -- \
  --trajectories <trajectories.jsonl> \
  [--predictions <predictions.jsonl>] \
  [--baseline deterministic|oracle] \
  [--output <summary.json>]
```

Prediction rows may use either:

```json
{"step_id": "...", "action": {"type": "tool_call", "tool": "...", "arguments": {}}}
```

or:

```json
{"step_id": "...", "target_action": {"type": "stop", "reason": "..."}}
```

Metrics:

- tool selection accuracy;
- argument validity;
- scope correctness;
- ref correctness;
- bounded/paginated request correctness;
- invalid tool call rate;
- future leak rate;
- known-at clean rate;
- stop accuracy;
- excess tool calls;
- elapsed latency by tool;
- answer-independent trajectory success.

Exit criteria:

- [x] a generalist LLM baseline and a deterministic baseline can be compared;
- [x] evaluation does not require access to expected benchmark answers;
- [ ] MemoryArena task `11` is classified as a reader/candidate failure, not an
  operator failure, when navigation/proof is clean.

Current evaluator metrics:

- missing predictions;
- invalid predictions;
- unbounded tool calls;
- action type accuracy;
- tool accuracy over target tool calls;
- primary ref accuracy over target tool calls;
- scope accuracy over target tool calls;
- stop accuracy over target stop actions;
- exact action accuracy.

Real deterministic baseline checks:

| Source trajectories | Tool accuracy | Ref accuracy | Scope accuracy | Stop accuracy | Invalid | Unbounded |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| MemoryArena 50-task read trajectories | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 0 | 0 |
| MemoryArena 100-task read trajectories | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 0 | 0 |

The exact JSON action score is lower, about `0.517`, because the deterministic
baseline intentionally reconstructs equivalent bounded actions and stops rather
than copying auxiliary `goal` text or exact `final_refs` from the recorded
target. For model comparison, tool/ref/scope/stop validity is the primary P1
signal.

### P1.3 Deterministic Baseline

Implement a simple rule baseline before training:

- inspect the current anchor;
- near around the latest known prior ref;
- trace only when there is a target ref and a bounded path need;
- stop when proof refs cover the current ask and no future refs appear.

This baseline is intentionally modest. It gives the operator model something
concrete to beat.

Implemented inside `kernel_operator_policy_eval` as `--baseline deterministic`.
It is not a trained model. It exists to provide a stable floor for future
generalist and small-model comparisons.

### P1.4 Generalist LLM Baseline

Replay the same trajectory items with a generalist model that emits only one
of:

- a JSON tool call;
- a JSON stop action.

The prompt must include:

- compact tool schema;
- explicit bounds;
- current visible state;
- no benchmark gold answer;
- no raw hidden memory.

This baseline measures whether a small operator can reduce tool calls, context
usage, invalid calls, and latency while preserving ref quality.

Implemented binary:

```text
cargo run -p rehydration-testkit --bin kernel_operator_llm_baseline -- \
  --trajectories <trajectory-dir>/trajectories.jsonl \
  --output <output-dir> \
  --endpoint <openai-compatible-chat-completions-url> \
  --model <model> \
  [--provider openai|openai-new|anthropic] \
  [--api-key-env LLM_API_KEY] \
  [--limit n] \
  [--offset n] \
  [--max-refs n] \
  [--force]
```

Outputs:

- `predictions.jsonl`: clean evaluator input with only `step_id` and `action`;
- `llm_results.jsonl`: raw model response, token counts, latency, and parsed
  action for audit;
- `failures.jsonl`: LLM call failures or rejected actions;
- `summary.json`: selected trajectory count, prediction count, invalid count,
  boundedness count, token usage, latency, and action distribution.

Guardrails:

- no `target_action`, `observed_outcome`, benchmark gold answer, or hidden raw
  memory is included in the prompt;
- visible refs are capped with `--max-refs`;
- rejected actions do not enter `predictions.jsonl`;
- tool calls must be bounded;
- tool names must be present in the trajectory action space;
- tool refs and stop refs must already be visible in `current_ref`,
  `trace_target_ref`, `known_refs`, or `last_observed_refs`;
- `kernel_inspect.include.raw` must be `false`.

Evaluation command after a run:

```text
cargo run -p rehydration-testkit --bin kernel_operator_policy_eval -- \
  --trajectories <trajectory-dir>/trajectories.jsonl \
  --predictions <llm-baseline-dir>/predictions.jsonl \
  --output <llm-baseline-dir>/policy-eval.json \
  [--limit n] \
  [--offset n]
```

Real OpenAI baseline smoke:

| Model | Slice | Prompt | Predictions | Failures | Exact | Tool | Ref | Scope | Stop | Invalid | Unbounded |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `gpt-4o-mini` | first 30 trajectories | initial | 23 | 7 | 0.300 | 0.696 | 0.696 | 0.696 | 0.857 | 0 | 0 |
| `gpt-4o-mini` | first 30 trajectories | explicit `about` rule | 30 | 0 | 0.533 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 0 | 0 |

The initial failure mode was useful: the generalist model used `current_ref` as
`kernel_near.arguments.about` instead of the top-level `about`. The prompt and
training data now state explicitly that `about` must equal the top-level scope.

### P1.5 First Small-Model Experiment

Only after P1.1-P1.4:

- choose a small function-calling or instruction model;
- train or fine-tune on exported trajectories;
- evaluate on held-out runs and task families;
- compare to deterministic and generalist baselines.

No model should be added to kernel core. It runs as a sidecar/client.

Implemented local training path:

```text
scripts/operator/prepare_operator_sft_dataset.py
scripts/operator/train_operator_sft_lora.py
scripts/operator/predict_operator_sft.py
scripts/operator/README.md
```

The first SFT dataset has been prepared from the 100-task trajectory export:

```text
python scripts/operator/prepare_operator_sft_dataset.py \
  --trajectories /tmp/kernel-operator-trajectories-100/trajectories.jsonl \
  --output /tmp/kernel-operator-sft-100 \
  --eval-ratio 0.1 \
  --seed 42 \
  --force
```

Result:

| Source | Selected | Train | Eval | Near | Inspect | Trace | Stop |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| MemoryArena 100-task read trajectories | 2,912 | 2,621 | 291 | 753 | 753 | 653 | 753 |

Leak check:

```text
rg -n 'target_action|observed_outcome|quality|gold|answer_session|has_answer' \
  /tmp/kernel-operator-sft-100/train.jsonl \
  /tmp/kernel-operator-sft-100/eval.jsonl
```

returned no matches. The target action exists only in the assistant message,
not in the model-facing user prompt.

Recommended first model:

```text
Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct
```

It is small enough for fast iteration and good enough to validate whether the
task is learnable before spending time on 1.5B/3B/7B variants.

First local training command:

```text
python scripts/operator/train_operator_sft_lora.py \
  --train-jsonl /tmp/kernel-operator-sft-100/train.jsonl \
  --eval-jsonl /tmp/kernel-operator-sft-100/eval.jsonl \
  --model-id Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct \
  --output-dir /tmp/kernel-operator-qwen05-lora \
  --epochs 3 \
  --batch-size 2 \
  --grad-accum 8 \
  --max-length 2048 \
  --bf16
```

Use `--fp16` instead of `--bf16` if the active GPU does not support bfloat16.

Current execution blocker in the Codex shell:

- `nvidia-smi` cannot communicate with the NVIDIA driver;
- Python training dependencies are not installed in this environment
  (`torch`, `transformers`, `trl`, `peft`);
- OpenAI accepted file upload, but fine-tuning is unavailable for the current
  organization (`training_not_available`).

These are environment issues, not dataset or code issues.

First local Kubernetes training run:

```text
kubectl apply -f k8s/kernel-operator-qwen05-lora-job.yaml
```

Training environment:

- model: `Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct`;
- method: LoRA SFT;
- GPU: 1x RTX 3090 requested through `nvidia.com/gpu: 1`;
- train rows: 2,621;
- eval rows: 291;
- epochs: 3;
- wall time: 58 minutes.

Final training metrics:

| Metric | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| train_loss | 0.05115 |
| eval_loss | 0.008344 |
| eval_mean_token_accuracy | 0.9965 |
| eval_samples_per_second | 6.479 |

Prediction run:

```text
kubectl apply -f k8s/kernel-operator-qwen05-predict-job.yaml
```

Prediction output:

```text
/tmp/kernel-operator-qwen05-predictions
```

Policy evaluation:

```text
cargo run -p rehydration-testkit --bin kernel_operator_policy_eval -- \
  --trajectories /tmp/kernel-operator-sft-100/eval_trajectories.jsonl \
  --predictions /tmp/kernel-operator-qwen05-predictions/predictions.jsonl \
  --output /tmp/kernel-operator-qwen05-policy-eval.json
```

Held-out eval result:

| Predictor | Total | Exact | Tool | Ref | Scope | Stop | Invalid | Unbounded |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Qwen 0.5B LoRA operator | 291 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 0 | 0 |
| Deterministic baseline | 291 | 0.515 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 0 | 0 |

Interpretation:

- the first operator model learned the current read-navigation policy exactly
  on the held-out split;
- the task is learnable by a very small model;
- this does not yet prove generalization beyond the MemoryArena
  progressive-search trajectory distribution;
- next held-out cuts should split by task id/run family, not only random
  trajectory rows.

### P1.5b Ref-Safe Dataset Hardening

The first LoRA result was useful, but the row split was too easy and the raw
refs were not acceptable for a serious training claim.

The grouped V2 training attempt was stopped intentionally after this was found.
V2 should not be used as a reported result.

Raw MemoryArena refs encode more than identity:

```text
...:task:82:subtask:5:question
...:task:82:subtask:5:answer
```

That naming can leak role, temporal position, and benchmark structure. Even if
the model never sees benchmark answers, it could learn to choose refs from the
shape of the string rather than from KMP visible state. That is not the model
we want.

The preparer now supports two hardening flags:

```text
--anonymize-refs
--require-visible-target-refs
```

`--anonymize-refs` rewrites the model-facing trajectory with stable synthetic
refs per decision step:

```text
about/current_ref/known_refs/target_action refs -> ref_0001, ref_0002, ...
```

The original trajectories are still written for audit:

```text
train_trajectories.jsonl
eval_trajectories.jsonl
all_trajectories.jsonl
```

The anonymized trajectories are written for model evaluation:

```text
train_model_trajectories.jsonl
eval_model_trajectories.jsonl
all_model_trajectories.jsonl
```

Predictions from the anonymized dataset must be evaluated against
`eval_model_trajectories.jsonl`, not against the raw audit trajectories.

`--require-visible-target-refs` drops any row whose target action refers to a
ref that is not present in:

```text
current_ref
trace_target_ref
candidate_refs
known_refs
last_observed_refs
```

This matters because the first writer-read export exposed a real issue: some
read-before-write `kernel_near` targets were only recoverable from the raw ref
naming pattern, not from visible state. Those rows are not valid training
examples for an operator model.

Strict dataset command:

```text
python scripts/operator/prepare_operator_sft_dataset.py \
  --trajectories /tmp/kernel-operator-trajectories-100-with-writer/trajectories.jsonl \
  --output /tmp/kernel-operator-sft-100-with-writer-by-task-anon-visible \
  --split-mode group \
  --group-key task_id \
  --eval-ratio 0.1 \
  --seed 42 \
  --anonymize-refs \
  --require-visible-target-refs \
  --force
```

Real output:

| Dataset | Source rows | Kept | Dropped non-visible refs | Train | Eval | Train groups | Eval groups |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 100-task read + writer reads, grouped by task, anonymized refs | 5,724 | 4,318 | 1,406 | 3,854 | 464 | 89 | 11 |

Kept rows by mode:

| Mode | Rows |
| --- | ---: |
| `read` | 2,912 |
| `write_context_read` | 1,406 |

Kept target actions:

| Target action | Rows |
| --- | ---: |
| `kernel_near` | 753 |
| `kernel_inspect` | 2,159 |
| `kernel_trace` | 653 |
| `stop` | 753 |

The dropped rows are currently the first writer context-read step where the
target ref is not yet visible. That means the next writer exporter improvement
is clear: if a writer is allowed to inspect a candidate, the candidate must be
explicitly present in visible state. Otherwise the row is not trainable without
leaking naming conventions.

Leak audit for model-facing messages:

```text
jq -c 'select((.messages|map(.content)|join("\n")|test("memoryarena:|:question|:answer|:subtask:|:task:|target_action|observed_outcome|quality|gold|answer_session|has_answer")))' \
  /tmp/kernel-operator-sft-100-with-writer-by-task-anon-visible/train.jsonl \
  /tmp/kernel-operator-sft-100-with-writer-by-task-anon-visible/eval.jsonl \
  /tmp/kernel-operator-sft-100-with-writer-by-task-anon-visible/openai_train.jsonl \
  /tmp/kernel-operator-sft-100-with-writer-by-task-anon-visible/openai_eval.jsonl
```

returned no model-facing matches.

The local trainer should use the messages-only files for training:

```text
openai_train.jsonl
openai_eval.jsonl
```

The prediction script still uses `eval.jsonl`, because it needs `step_id` to
write evaluator-compatible predictions. `step_id` is metadata for the runner,
not part of the prompt.

Evaluator sanity checks on the anonymized eval set:

| Predictor | Total | Exact | Tool | Ref | Scope | Stop | Invalid | Unbounded |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Oracle baseline | 464 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 0 | 0 |
| Deterministic baseline | 464 | 0.349 | 1.000 | 0.606 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 0 | 0 |

The deterministic baseline losing ref accuracy after anonymization is expected
and useful: it shows that simple rules can no longer benefit from raw ref
naming. The next trained operator should beat this baseline by using visible
state, not benchmark-shaped ids.

Next V3 training rule:

- train on `openai_train.jsonl` / `openai_eval.jsonl`;
- predict on `eval.jsonl`;
- evaluate predictions against `eval_model_trajectories.jsonl`;
- keep `eval_trajectories.jsonl` only for audit against the original kernel
  refs.

| Qwen 0.5B LoRA V3 | 464 | 0.996 | 1.000 | 0.995 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 0 | 0 |

The two V3 misses are both in `write_context_read`. In both cases the model
selected the correct tool, bounded scope, and action type, but chose a different
visible `kernel_inspect` ref from the same candidate set. There were no missing
predictions, invalid JSON actions, unbounded tool calls, wrong tools, wrong
scopes, or wrong stop actions.

This is the first credible operator-model result because:

- benchmark-shaped raw refs are not visible to the prompt;
- train/eval is grouped by task;
- target refs must be visible to the model;
- evaluation is against anonymized model trajectories, not the raw audit
  trajectories.

Remaining gaps after V3:

- batched prediction is now acceptable for offline replay, but still not a live
  serving path: 464 rows took 3m24s with `--batch-size 8`, including dependency
  installation and model load;
- 1,406 writer-read rows were intentionally dropped because the target ref was
  not visible to the prompt; the exporter must expose valid candidates rather
  than relying on raw ref shape;
- the result is held out by task, but still from one 100-task MemoryArena run;
  the next credible step is a larger run and a family-held-out split;
- live MCP validation is still separate from offline policy replay;
- writer relation proposals should remain disabled until the read operator is
  validated at larger scale.

### P1.6 Candidate-Visible Writer Hardening

The V3 result was credible, but it exposed a dataset construction gap: 1,406
writer-read rows were dropped because their target refs were valid candidates
for the writer but were not present in the model-facing visible state. That is
not acceptable for a training claim. If the operator is allowed to choose a ref,
that ref must be visible without relying on raw naming conventions.

The exporter now adds `visible_state.candidate_refs` for writer context-read
steps. Candidate refs are gathered from:

- writer read context inspected refs;
- writer read context temporal refs;
- planned relation targets;
- relation-quality targets;
- primary refs already present in the recorded pre-read tool calls.

The current entry ref is excluded. The preparer now treats `candidate_refs` as
part of the visible ref set for strict target-ref validation and prompt
compaction.

The four V4 misses are all in `write_context_read` for the same MemoryArena
task family slice. They use the correct action type, tool, bounded arguments,
scope, and stop behavior, but choose a different visible candidate ref. This is
not a leak or boundedness issue. It points to the next dataset/modeling gap:
candidate refs are visible, but still unranked and mostly untyped. A stronger
writer-operator dataset should expose candidate roles, relation intent, or
writer evidence summaries rather than only a flat candidate ref list.

### P1.7 Writer Candidate Details

The next hardening step is to make writer candidates understandable without
leaking the writer's final relation decision.

The exporter now adds `visible_state.candidate_ref_details` beside
`candidate_refs`. Each detail is deliberately structural:

```json
{
  "ref": "ref_0002",
  "role": "same_subtask_question",
  "turn_kind": "question",
  "relative_position": "same_subtask",
  "temporal_distance": 0,
  "priority": 10,
  "relation_hint": "answer_addresses_question",
  "sources": ["writer_candidate_pool"]
}
```

What is intentionally not included:

- final `connect_to.rel`;
- final relation `why`;
- final relation evidence;
- raw memory text;
- benchmark answer labels;
- source names that reveal which candidate became the recorded action.

This matters because a writer operator should learn how to choose between
visible candidates, not memorize the post-hoc relation emitted by the writer.
The current source is normalized as `writer_candidate_pool` to avoid turning
candidate provenance into a label leak. The useful signal is structural:
turn kind, relative temporal position, candidate role, and bounded priority.

Candidate-detail export:

```text
cargo run -p rehydration-testkit --bin kernel_operator_trajectory_export -- \
  --run /tmp/memoryarena-smart-writer-paged-100tasks-20260508-1407-run \

Leak audit returned no model-facing rows for raw MemoryArena refs, target
actions, observed outcomes, quality fields, benchmark gold labels, answer
session ids, or `has_answer`.

The V5 training run uses the same base model and split as V4, but with
candidate details in the model-facing visible state:

| Item | Value |

| Base model | `Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct` |
| Adapter | `/tmp/kernel-operator-qwen05-lora-v5` |

| `train_samples_per_second` | 7.326 |
| `train_steps_per_second` | 0.459 |

Held-out candidate-detail eval result:

| Predictor | Total | Exact | Tool | Ref | Scope | Stop | Invalid | Unbounded |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |

| Qwen 0.5B LoRA V5 | 615 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 0 | 0 |

V5 closed the four V4 writer-context-read misses. The important change is not
more hidden answer signal; it is better visible structure around the candidate
refs. The model sees candidate role, turn kind, relative temporal position,
priority, and a relation hint, while the final relation decision and evidence
remain hidden.

### P1.8 Explicit Holdout Validation

V5 proved that candidate details closed the remaining writer-context-read
misses, but the eval split was still produced by a seeded ratio over task
groups. P1.8 makes the holdout explicit and larger so the result is easier to
repeat and audit.

The SFT preparer now supports explicit group holdouts:

```text
--eval-group-values
--eval-group-values-file
```

It also supports additional group keys:

```text
task_id
task_type
task_family
mode
about
run_id
```

The V6 validation reserved task ids `80` through `99` for evaluation:

```text
python scripts/operator/prepare_operator_sft_dataset.py \
  --trajectories /tmp/kernel-operator-trajectories-100-with-writer-candidate-details/trajectories.jsonl \
  --output /tmp/kernel-operator-sft-100-with-writer-by-task-anon-visible-candidate-details-holdout20 \

```

This does not prove cross-benchmark generalization or live MCP serving
robustness. It does prove that the operator is not only memorizing the smaller
V5 split: with benchmark-shaped refs hidden, it generalizes across a larger
explicit held-out task range inside the same MemoryArena run.

### P1.9 Raw-Ref Replay Bridge

The V6 result is intentionally evaluated on anonymized model trajectories. That
is the right training/eval boundary because the model must not learn from raw
MemoryArena ref shape. But it creates a practical follow-up: a live MCP replay
cannot execute `ref_0001`.

P1.9 adds an explicit de-anonymization bridge outside kernel core:

```text
scripts/operator/deanonymize_operator_predictions.py
```

Inputs:

- raw audit trajectories: `eval_trajectories.jsonl`;
- anonymized model trajectories: `eval_model_trajectories.jsonl`;
- model predictions: `predictions.jsonl`.

Outputs:

- raw-ref `predictions.jsonl` for evaluator and future live replay;
- `audit.jsonl` showing model action, raw action, and mapped refs;
- `failures.jsonl` for unmappable predictions;
- `summary.json`.

The mapping is derived only from paired raw/model trajectory state for the same
`step_id`. If the model predicts a synthetic ref that was not visible in that
trajectory, the row fails fast. There is no fallback and no invented ref.

V6 holdout20 de-anonymization result:

| Item | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| Selected predictions | 1,124 |
| Written raw predictions | 1,124 |
| Failures | 0 |
| Mapped synthetic refs | 5,240 |

Raw-ref policy eval remained exact:

| Predictor | Total | Exact | Tool | Ref | Scope | Stop | Invalid | Unbounded |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Qwen 0.5B LoRA V6 holdout20, de-anonymized | 1,124 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 0 | 0 |

This is not live MCP validation yet. It is the required bridge before live
validation: the same prediction can now be inspected in model-ref form and raw
kernel-ref form without contaminating the training prompt.

### P1.10 Live MCP Replay

Raw-ref policy evaluation still runs offline: it compares JSON actions against
JSON targets. The next validation step is to execute those predicted actions
through the real MCP adapter against the deployed kernel.

P1.10 adds:

```text
cargo run -p rehydration-testkit --bin kernel_operator_mcp_replay
```

The replayer takes:

- raw audit trajectories;
- raw-ref predictions from the de-anonymizer;
- a live kernel endpoint, usually
  `https://rehydration-kernel.underpassai.com`.

For long runs, `--log-progress-every N` emits compact JSONL progress events to
stderr so the operator can see which trajectory step is being replayed without
parsing Kubernetes logs.

It executes only bounded tool calls. `stop` actions are recorded but do not call
MCP. For tool calls, the replayer verifies:

- MCP returns a successful JSON-RPC response;
- the response contains typed `structuredContent`;
- every ref observed in the audited trajectory is present in the live response.

This is deliberately stricter than "the JSON action looked right". It proves the
operator action can be replayed through the same MCP/gRPC boundary an agent
would use.

Observed 100-step V6 holdout smoke on 2026-05-11:

| Item | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| Selected trajectory steps | 100 |
| Executed tool calls | 85 |
| Stop actions | 15 |
| Successful tool calls | 85 |
| Failed tool calls | 0 |
| Missing expected ref rows | 0 |
| Missing predictions | 0 |
| Invalid predictions | 0 |
| Unbounded tool calls | 0 |

Observed full V6 holdout20 replay on 2026-05-11:

| Item | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| Selected trajectory steps | 1,124 |
| Executed tool calls | 976 |
| Stop actions | 148 |
| Successful tool calls | 976 |
| Failed tool calls | 0 |
| Missing expected ref rows | 0 |
| Missing predictions | 0 |
| Invalid predictions | 0 |
| Unbounded tool calls | 0 |
| Extra observed ref rows | 848 |
| Elapsed | 7m18.7s |

Extra observed refs mean the live kernel returned additional valid context
beyond the audited minimum. The correctness gate is missing expected refs, not
the presence of extra inspectable context.

Full replay latency by action against the public TLS endpoint:

| Action | Count | Avg ms | Max ms |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `kernel_near` | 424 | 922.2 | 1,738 |
| `kernel_inspect` | 424 | 79.2 | 146 |
| `kernel_trace` | 128 | 105.9 | 168 |
| `stop` | 148 | 0.0 | 0 |

The current signal is good: correctness holds through MCP, but `kernel_near`
dominates live replay latency. That makes candidate retrieval performance and
pagination/budget behavior the next operational thing to watch as the holdout
scales.

### P1.11 Scale, Pagination, And Publication Gate

P1.10 proves that the current V6 operator predictions are executable through
the real MCP/gRPC boundary. It does not yet prove that the operator generalizes
across a larger corpus. The next cut should keep kernel core unchanged and
scale the same training/evaluation path.

Top 1 requirement: P1.11.0 pagination/progress/resume gate.

- `kernel_trace` must keep returning bounded paths with explicit page metadata:
  cursor, `has_more`, returned count, and budget consumed.
- `kernel_near`, `goto`, `rewind`, and `forward` must expose the same bounded
  pagination semantics through both gRPC/KMP and MCP.
- Remote audit tools must report progress by about/task and support limit,
  offset or cursor-based resume. A long audit must not look like a hung
  process.
- Operator trajectories must include page metadata in `visible_state` when a
  tool result is partial, so the operator can learn when to continue, narrow
  scope, or stop.
- Publication requires a clean replay/audit where no tool call requests an
  unbounded history and no `trace` silently materializes the whole graph.

P1.11.0 first implementation slice:

- `memoryarena_kmp_run_audit` now supports `--limit`, `--offset`,
  `--log-progress-every`, and `--progress-output`.
- Remote inspect audit summaries now report `total_refs`, `offset`, `limit`,
  `checked_refs`, `next_offset`, and global `completed`.
- Audit progress events include `processed`, `selected`, `total`,
  `next_offset`, `page_completed`, global `completed`, found/missing/error
  counts, and elapsed time.
- Resume is explicit: rerun with `--offset <inspect.next_offset>` or the last
  progress event's `next_offset`.
- Live smoke against the public TLS endpoint validated page 0, page 1, and a
  single-ref page over the 221-task MemoryArena run with found refs and no
  errors.
- Temporal movement responses now carry `PageInfo` in the API contract for
  `Goto`, `Near`, `Rewind`, and `Forward`; the MCP adapter maps the same page
  object into `kernel_goto`, `kernel_near`, `kernel_rewind`, and
  `kernel_forward` structured output.
- `kernel_operator_mcp_replay` already exposes `--limit`, `--offset`, and
  `--log-progress-every`; replay rows now record `partial_result` and `page`,
  and summaries count partial results by action.

Input rules:

- use a fresh audited MemoryArena smart-writer run, not only prepared
  cost-estimate rows;
- keep train/eval split grouped by task id or run family, never by individual
  trajectory row;
- use a fresh `run_id` / `about` namespace for every live kernel run;
- keep synthetic model-facing refs for training and evaluation;
- keep de-anonymized raw refs only for offline policy evaluation and live MCP
  replay;
- do not expose benchmark answers, hidden tool outcomes, final writer
  relations, or future refs in the model-facing prompt.

Live run hygiene:

- do not reuse a `run_id` after a non-smart or partial smoke has written data
  to the deployed kernel;
- if a smoke is repeated, regenerate artifacts with a new `run_id`;
- a repeated run over the same `about` can make early asks observe answer
  feedback written by the previous run, producing false future-leak failures.

Trajectory export and SFT preparation from that run:

Baseline checks on the anonymized eval split:

| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Oracle | 1,288 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 0 | 0 |
| Deterministic | 1,288 | 0.264 | 1.000 | 0.435 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 0 | 0 |

The deterministic baseline losing ref accuracy after anonymization is expected
and useful: the larger corpus no longer lets a rule recover the right ref from
the raw MemoryArena id shape. The operator must use visible state and tool
observations.

The local artifact cache for this cut is outside the repository tree at
`../rehydration-kernel-artifacts/operator/p111-pageinfo-221-20260512/`. It
contains large benchmark runs, JSONL trajectories, SFT splits, logs, and audit
outputs copied from `/tmp`.

The 221-task run was recorded before temporal `page` metadata existed in stored
MCP navigation rows, so its exported trajectories do not contain historical
`page` or `partial_result` values. The trajectory exporter now preserves that
metadata when source rows carry it. Page metadata is already validated through
live KMP/MCP calls and must be captured by future page-aware replay or fresh
page-aware benchmark runs.

This run is the first useful P1.11 scale corpus, but the remote `--inspect`
audit exposed why P1.11.0 is now top priority: an exhaustive audit over
thousands of remote `inspect` calls is too opaque while it runs. Large audits
and graph traversal must be paged, bounded, resumable, and observable in the
same way normal KMP reads are.

Recommended run order:

1. Implement and validate P1.11.0 pagination/progress/resume for KMP/MCP
   traversal, remote audit, and replay.
2. Generate or select the next larger MemoryArena run. Target the 221-task
   progressive set when cost and time are acceptable; use a smaller stepped
   run only as a smoke.
3. Run local scorecard and remote audit with progress/pagination enabled.
4. Export trajectories with writer candidate details.
5. Prepare a grouped, anonymized, visible-ref-only split.
6. Run deterministic and generalist baselines on the same eval set.
7. Train the same small Qwen 0.5B LoRA recipe from scratch.
8. Predict on the held-out set and evaluate against anonymized trajectories.
9. De-anonymize predictions and run raw-ref policy evaluation.
10. Run live MCP replay first with `--limit 100`, then full replay only if the
   smoke has zero missing predictions, invalid predictions, unbounded calls,
   MCP failures, and missing expected refs.

Metrics to publish for this cut:

- trajectory count, train count, eval count, grouped split rule;
- exact/tool/ref/scope/stop accuracy;
- invalid prediction and unbounded call counts;
- deterministic baseline comparison;
- generalist LLM baseline comparison, if cost allows;
- live MCP replay success, missing expected refs, extra observed refs, and
  latency by action;
- prompt leak audit result.

Exit criteria:

- P1.11.0 pagination/progress/resume reports prove that `trace`, `near`,
  temporal moves, replay, and audit stay bounded at 221-task scale or higher;
- no model-facing leak of raw MemoryArena refs or benchmark answers;
- zero invalid and unbounded operator actions on the held-out set;
- live MCP replay has zero MCP failures and zero missing expected refs;
- latency report shows whether `kernel_near` remains the dominant cost;
- failures, if any, are classified as operator, kernel retrieval, writer,
  reader, or benchmark/domain reasoning.

## Fast Training Path

The goal is fast iteration, not a large first model. The first operator model
should prove that a small specialist can choose bounded kernel tools better
than a generalist baseline on the same replayable trajectories.

### Hardware Assumption

Target local hardware:

- 4x RTX 3090;
- 24 GB VRAM per GPU;
- local fine-tuning with LoRA/QLoRA;
- offline replay evaluation before live-kernel validation.

Expected first useful training durations:

| Model size | Method | Expected iteration time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0.5B-1.5B | LoRA or full small-model fine-tune | 30 min - 3 h |
| 3B | LoRA | 2 - 6 h |
| 7B-8B | QLoRA | 6 - 18 h |
| 14B | QLoRA | 1 - 3 days |

The first slice should prefer 0.5B-1.5B or 3B. A 7B/8B model is useful only
after the dataset and evaluator are clean.

### Speed Principles

1. Train on decisions, not whole tasks.

Each item should be:

```text
visible_state -> next_tool_call_or_stop
```

Do not include full conversations, full graph dumps, or hidden benchmark
answers in the model-facing input.

2. Start with a small action space.

Initial read/navigation actions:

- `kernel_near`
- `kernel_inspect`
- `kernel_trace`
- `stop`

Hold back until later:

- `kernel_goto`
- `kernel_rewind`
- `kernel_forward`
- `kernel_write_memory`

This reduces ambiguity and lets the first model learn the highest-frequency
navigation moves before temporal movement and write policy are added.

3. Distill from multiple sources.

Generate candidate trajectories from:

- successful audited MemoryArena MCP runs;
- deterministic navigation baseline;
- generalist LLM baseline;
- classified hard negatives.

Only train on failed trajectories when the failure reason is labelled. Broken
logs without labels should be excluded.

4. Use curriculum stages.

Recommended stages:

- valid JSON action;
- valid tool name;
- bounded arguments;
- valid refs and scopes;
- correct next tool;
- correct stop decision;
- pagination and temporal movement;
- writer relation proposal with cited evidence.

Do not mix all stages on day one. If JSON validity or bounded arguments fail,
later training metrics are not meaningful.

5. Cache evaluation.

The evaluator should run offline from exported trajectories and cached tool
results. Live kernel calls are reserved for final validation, not every training
iteration.

6. Measure cheap metrics first.

Fast-loop metrics:

- JSON validity;
- tool selection accuracy;
- invalid ref rate;
- invalid scope rate;
- unbounded call rate;
- stop accuracy;
- excess tool calls;
- future leak rate;
- known-at clean rate.

Do not wait for an end-to-end benchmark score to decide whether a checkpoint is
usable.

### Five-Day Fast Track

Day 1:

- implement the trajectory exporter;
- export the MemoryArena 50-task run;
- validate redaction and mixed-run rejection.

Day 2:

- implement deterministic baseline;
- implement offline evaluator;
- produce baseline summary.

Day 3:

- train first 0.5B-1.5B or 3B LoRA checkpoint;
- evaluate offline against deterministic baseline.

Day 4:

- run a generalist LLM baseline on the same trajectory items;
- compare tool calls, invalid actions, boundedness, and stop decisions.

Day 5:

- run live-kernel validation on a small held-out slice;
- package dataset card, model card draft, and evaluation summary for Hugging
  Face publication.

### Hugging Face Publication Path

Publish only after redaction, evaluation, and live replay are credible. The
release checklist is tracked in
[`kernel-tool-operator-publication-plan.md`](kernel-tool-operator-publication-plan.md).

Recommended artifacts:

- dataset: `underpass-ai/kernel-operator-trajectories`;
- model: `underpass-ai/kernel-tool-operator-small`;
- optional Space: `underpass-ai/kernel-operator-demo`.

Correct positioning:

> A small specialist model trained to operate Underpass Kernel memory tools
> through bounded, auditable trajectories.

Avoid claims that it is a general QA model, a memory database, or a replacement
for the kernel.

### LongMemEval Mixed-Trajectory Slice

The Operator dataset should not learn only the MemoryArena graph shape. The
LongMemEval rows are exported by a separate binary,
`longmemeval_operator_trajectory_export`, but use the same
`kernel-operator-trajectory-v1` output contract as MemoryArena.

Current preserved local cache:

```text
../rehydration-kernel-artifacts/operator/longmemeval-valid-20260512/
```

Exported LongMemEval trajectory counts:

| Source | Trajectories | Notes |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Balanced60 v6 | 120 | `kernel_ask` + stop rows |
| 100-prefix v6 | 200 | `kernel_ask` + stop rows |
| MS30 smart writer | 268 | `kernel_ask`, stop, `kernel_near`, `kernel_inspect` writer reads |

Mixed MemoryArena P1.11 + LongMemEval SFT output:

```text
../rehydration-kernel-artifacts/operator/longmemeval-valid-20260512/kernel-operator-sft-mixed-memoryarena-longmemeval-20260512/
```

Summary:

- total model-facing rows: 13,053;
- train rows: 11,729;
- eval rows: 1,324;
- split mode: grouped by `task_id`; LongMemEval maps this to `question_id`;
- dropped non-visible target refs: 0;
- no-gold audit findings: 0.

Action mix:

| Action | Rows |
| --- | ---: |
| `kernel_near` | 4,806 |
| `kernel_inspect` | 4,806 |
| `kernel_trace` | 1,420 |
| `kernel_ask` | 190 |
| `stop` | 1,831 |

The no-gold audit checks the model-facing OpenAI JSONL files for
`target_action`, `observed_outcome`, `expected_answer`,
`expected_answer_turn_refs`, `answer_session_ids`, `answer_session_refs`,
`has_answer`, and gold-label markers.

### LongMemEval 500 Full-History Smoke

The cleaned LongMemEval-S file was restored from Hugging Face and preserved
outside the repo:

```text
../rehydration-kernel-artifacts/operator/longmemeval-valid-20260512/datasets/longmemeval_s_cleaned.json
```

The 500-item adapter pass completed:

- prepared items: 500;
- sessions: 23,867;
- turns: 246,750;
- expected evidence turns: 896;
- abstention items: 30.

The first live smoke initially exposed an infrastructure regression:

```text
Valkey TLS failed with UnknownIssuer because valkey.tls was enabled for the
server but valkeyTls was disabled for the kernel client.
```

The deployed release was corrected with Helm revision 128 by enabling
`valkeyTls.enabled=true` and mounting `rehydration-kernel-valkey-tls`.

After redeploy, a one-item full-history smoke against the public TLS endpoint
completed:

| Metric | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| Items | 1 |
| Ingested entries | 551 |
| Full evidence hits | 1 / 1 |
| Elapsed | 130,052 ms |

The smoke used the MCP runner path. A direct Codex MCP check also exercised
`kernel_ingest`, `kernel_ask`, `kernel_near`, and `kernel_inspect` against the
same live kernel boundary on the isolated about
`codex:mcp:operator-longmemeval-smoke:20260512`.

Do not treat this as the publishable LongMemEval-500 score. The full 500 run was
not launched in this slice because the smoke projects to many hours, and the
current LongMemEval adapter still uses `has_answer` to emit `supports_answer`
relations when no generated labels are provided. A publishable official-style
run needs a context-construction path that does not use `has_answer`,
`answer_session_ids`, or gold answer metadata.

## Next Execution Slice

The original first-slice checklist is complete. The next execution slice is
P1.11:

1. produce a larger audited MemoryArena smart-writer run;
2. export trajectories with candidate details;
3. prepare a grouped anonymized split;
4. train and evaluate the small operator from scratch;
5. de-anonymize predictions;
6. replay them through live MCP;
7. update this document with the larger-run table before making any public
   model claim.

Do not publish the dataset or model until the leak audit, offline policy eval,
and live MCP replay are all clean.

## Open Questions

- Should write-mode trajectories be a separate dataset from read-mode
  trajectories? Initial answer: yes.
- Should the operator be allowed to call `kernel_ask`, or should `ask` be the
  reader's terminal move? Initial answer: allow it, but score overuse.
- Should the model learn relation writing directly? Initial answer: only after
  read/navigation is stable, and only with proof-cited relations.
- Should the first public release use only read/navigation actions, or include
  writer relation proposal? Initial answer: keep the first public operator
  read/navigation only.

## Success Criteria For P1

P1 is successful when we can say:

- kernel tool-use trajectories are exported reproducibly;
- a baseline can be scored without benchmark gold answers;
- the operator policy is bounded and auditable;
- tool-call efficiency can be compared against a generalist LLM;
- de-anonymized predictions can be replayed through live MCP/gRPC;
- failures are classified by stage: operator, kernel retrieval, reader, writer,
  or benchmark/domain reasoning.

The article angle then becomes stronger:

> The kernel does not only store temporal multidimensional memory. It emits
> auditable tool-use trajectories that can train and evaluate smaller specialist
> operators for memory navigation.
