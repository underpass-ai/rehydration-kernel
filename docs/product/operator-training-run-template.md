# Operator Training Run: `<attempt-id>`

Status: `planned | dataset-ready | running | paused | failed | quarantined | baseline-only | internal-only | promoted | aborted`

Date opened: `YYYY-MM-DD`
Date closed: `YYYY-MM-DD or pending`
Owner: `Tirso / Codex / other`

## 1. Scope

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Attempt id | `<attempt-id>` |
| Profile | `operator-read / prepared-write / writer-teacher / mixed` |
| Base model | `<model id>` |
| Adapter output | `<path or hub id>` |
| Artifact root | `../rehydration-kernel-artifacts/operator/<attempt-id>/` |
| Branch | `<branch>` |
| Commit | `<sha>` |
| Dirty worktree at start | `yes/no + summary` |

## 2. North Star Check

```text
Operator 0.5B:
  only learns to use KMP.

Strong teacher:
  produces semantics when semantics are needed.

Kernel:
  validates, stores, traverses, proves, and audits memory.
```

This run respects the boundary because:

- `<explain why the Operator is not being trained as a semantic memory author>`;
- `<explain whether any teacher model is involved>`;
- `<explain whether kernel core remains deterministic>`.

## 3. Hypothesis

Main hypothesis:

```text
<What this run is expected to prove or disprove.>
```

Success means:

- `<metric/gate>`;
- `<metric/gate>`;
- `<metric/gate>`.

Failure means:

- `<specific failure condition>`;
- `<specific failure condition>`.

| --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| `<name>` | `<capability>` | `<n>` | `<before -> after>` | `<metric delta>` | `improves / neutral / regresses / unsafe / unproven` |
