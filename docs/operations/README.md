Key rule:

- this repo owns kernel operations and contract documentation
- this repo owns the standalone kernel image artifact
- this repo owns the standalone kernel Helm chart
- sibling repos may own runnable deployment packaging such as GHCR images,
  Docker Compose bundles, or Helm charts when those artifacts package a runtime
  or product layer rather than the kernel itself
