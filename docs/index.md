# Documentation Index

Navigation hub for kernel documentation.

Current integration stance:

- `GraphBatch -> translator -> async projection events` is the recommended write path for model-driven producers.
- The stable kernel boundary remains typed gRPC plus async projection subjects.
- Kernel Memory Protocol is implemented API-first over domain/application/gRPC;
  MCP is an adapter over that API, not the owner of memory behavior.
- The active product roadmap is
  [`product/kernel-roadmap-milestones.md`](product/kernel-roadmap-milestones.md).
- Documentation authority and historical/obsolete areas are cataloged in
  [`documentation-catalog.md`](documentation-catalog.md).
- The dedicated `repair-judge` is an experimental stabilization helper for model extraction. It is not part of the stable kernel contract.

Six earlier decisions (command/query split, projection model, TLS, compatibility
removal, multi-resolution tiers) are documented in PRs but not yet written as
formal ADRs. See [adr/README.md](adr/README.md) for the source PRs.

## Current Integration Contracts

## Historical Migration References

PIR and fix-planning migration notes are retained for traceability but are not
the current kernel contract. Use [migration/README.md](migration/README.md) and
[documentation-catalog.md](documentation-catalog.md) to decide whether a note is
still relevant before applying it to current work.
