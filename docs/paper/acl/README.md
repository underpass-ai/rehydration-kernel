# ACL Submission Package

This directory contains an ACL-style LaTeX package derived from
[`docs/PAPER_SUBMISSION_DRAFT.md`](../../PAPER_SUBMISSION_DRAFT.md).

The current manuscript covers four use cases:

- failure diagnosis with rehydration-point recovery
- why-implementation reconstruction
- interrupted handoff with resumable execution
- constraint-preserving retrieval under token pressure

## Files

- `main.tex`: ACL review-mode draft, with line numbers
- `main-preprint.tex`: ACL preprint-mode draft, without review line numbers
- `main.pdf`: compiled ACL review PDF (build locally, not committed)
- `main-preprint.pdf`: compiled ACL preprint PDF (build locally, not committed)
- `references.bib`: bibliography used by the draft
- `acl.sty`: official ACL style file vendored into the repo
- `acl_natbib.bst`: official ACL bibliography style vendored into the repo

## Style Files

The official ACL style files are already vendored in this directory. Source:

- https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files

## Build

From this directory:

```bash
pdflatex main.tex
bibtex main
pdflatex main.tex
pdflatex main.tex
```

For a readable local PDF without review line numbers:

```bash
pdflatex main-preprint.tex
bibtex main-preprint
pdflatex main-preprint.tex
pdflatex main-preprint.tex
```

The paper-use-case artifact used in the Results section is generated from the
repository root with:

```bash
bash scripts/ci/integration-paper-use-cases.sh
```

That script writes:

- `artifacts/paper-use-cases/summary.json`
- `artifacts/paper-use-cases/results.md`
- `artifacts/paper-use-cases/results.csv`
- `artifacts/paper-use-cases/results-figures.md`

`main.tex` defaults to anonymous review mode:

```tex
\usepackage[review]{acl}
```

`main-preprint.tex` uses:

```tex
\usepackage[preprint]{acl}
```

To switch to camera-ready mode later, replace it with:

```tex
\usepackage{acl}
```
