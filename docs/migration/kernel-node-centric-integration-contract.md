# Kernel Node-Centric Integration Contract

Status: v1beta1 (see [beta-status.md](../beta-status.md) for maturity and path to v1)

## Purpose

Define the public contract that any system may depend on to integrate with
the rehydration kernel.

The kernel originated as a context engine for `swe-ai-fleet` and is designed
to be adopted by that product as its primary context provider. However, the
contract is generic — no product-specific nouns are part of the kernel surface.

## Contract Boundary

### 1. gRPC contract

Package: `underpass.rehydration.kernel.v1beta1`

Services:

- `ContextQueryService` — GetContext, GetContextPath, GetNodeDetail, RehydrateSession, ValidateScope
- `ContextCommandService` — UpdateContext

Primary identifiers:

- `root_node_id` — bundle anchor (any node in the graph)
- `node_id`, `node_kind` — entity identity and type
- `relationship_type` — edge label
- `semantic_class` — causal, motivational, evidential, constraint, procedural, structural
- `BundleNodeDetail` — extended per-node content
- `RehydrationBundle` — validated context container

### 2. Async contract (NATS JetStream)

Inbound (kernel consumes):

- `{prefix}.graph.node.materialized` — nodes + relationships
- `{prefix}.node.detail.materialized` — extended detail

Outbound (kernel publishes):

- `{prefix}.context.bundle.generated` — **contract-only; not yet emitted by runtime**

Defined in [`api/asyncapi/context-projection.v1beta1.yaml`](../../api/asyncapi/context-projection.v1beta1.yaml).

## What Consumers May Rely On

- `root_node_id` is the primary bundle anchor
- Graph reads are expressed in terms of nodes and relationships
- Extended node context is carried as generic node detail
- Render budget, focus, tiers, and mode are generic request concerns
- Snapshot persistence is generic
- Async projection inputs remain node-centric

## What the Kernel Does NOT Own

The kernel does not contain product-specific nouns. If an integration requires
the kernel to understand domain-specific entity types, that mapping belongs in
an anti-corruption layer outside the kernel.

## Stability Rules

For `v1beta1` gRPC and async subjects:

- Do not rename services, methods, or field names without a version bump
- Do not replace `root_node_id` with product-specific identifiers
- Do not add product nouns to message or field names
- Do not couple async subjects to one product's event vocabulary
- Prefer additive changes over semantic rewrites

Breaking: renaming `root_node_id`, changing service names, changing semantic
meaning of fields, renaming async subjects.

Non-breaking: adding optional request/response fields, adding new services
or methods, adding new async subjects.

## Evidence

This contract is backed by:

- Proto: [`api/proto/underpass/rehydration/kernel/v1beta1`](../../api/proto/underpass/rehydration/kernel/v1beta1)
- AsyncAPI: [`api/asyncapi/context-projection.v1beta1.yaml`](../../api/asyncapi/context-projection.v1beta1.yaml)
- Fixtures: [`api/examples/kernel/v1beta1`](../../api/examples/kernel/v1beta1)
- Contract tests: `kernel_v1beta1_contract_tests.rs`, `reference_fixture_contract_tests.rs`, `asyncapi_contract_tests.rs`
