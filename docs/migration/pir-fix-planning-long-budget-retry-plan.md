# PIR Fix Planning Long-Budget Retry Plan

Status: in_progress
Date: 2026-04-12
Scope: next iteration series for the first real `PIR` event-driven agent after
the initial `fix_planning` live smokes

Companion research note:

- [`pir-fix-planning-model-research-notes.md`](pir-fix-planning-model-research-notes.md)
- [`pir-fix-planning-experiment-matrix.md`](pir-fix-planning-experiment-matrix.md)

## Intent

Define the next reliability-oriented iteration series for `fix_planning`.

This plan changes one core assumption from the earlier slice:

- the system should no longer optimize first for short wall-clock latency
- it should optimize first for giving the LLM a real chance to understand and
  mitigate a production incident

Operational product stance for this series:

- a `15-20` minute wall-clock budget is acceptable for a productive incident if
  the agent can act autonomously and truthfully
- early prompt shrinking, token squeezing, and other premature latency
  optimizations are explicitly not the first move

## Why A New Plan Is Needed

The earlier slice plan in
[`pir-first-event-driven-agent-plan.md`](pir-first-event-driven-agent-plan.md)
set a conservative timing policy:

- runtime/session setup: `<= 5s`
- graph read: `<= 5s`
- primary LLM attempt: `<= 20s`
- optional second attempt: `<= 20s`
- publish: `<= 10s`
- total task budget: `<= 45s`

That was useful as a first safety-oriented proving slice. It is no longer the
right default for an autonomy-oriented incident workflow.

The live smokes showed a different reality:

- runtime and kernel graph read are not the dominant bottlenecks
- the first LLM JSON completion is the real limiting step
- the current retry count and sub-budgets are too small to give the model a
  serious chance

Current observed failure mode:

- runtime returns successfully
- kernel local read returns successfully
- the first `CompleteJSON` call times out under the current sub-budget
- later retries do not materially change the outcome
- the system escalates truthfully

That is better than false success, but it is still not a serious autonomy
budget.

## Grounded Starting Point

What is already true now:

- the `PIR -> runtime -> kernel` path is live
- `fix_planning` already runs as an event-driven task
- local graph read is already in use
- failure is now truthful at the stage boundary
- the smoke harness now reports the real `.failed` / `.escalated` outcome and
  applies the result through the same stage-result transition path used by the
  service
- the deployed `PIR` has now produced at least one real `fix_planning.completed`
  outcome under the long-budget `A0` policy, with valid kernel read-back
- internal planner sub-attempts are now exposed as first-class execution
  evidence in the deployed smoke output
- the deployed smoke can now load named YAML scenarios instead of relying on
  only one built-in hardcoded incident shape
- the first widened YAML scenario batch has now completed `3/3` truthful live
  runs on the deployed `A0` baseline

What is still open:

- fallback model support is not yet wired
- specialized graph roles are not yet showing meaningful divergence in the live
  graph
- wider scenario coverage has not yet been sampled enough to declare `A0`
  robust across incident families
- we still do not have a promotion decision between staying on `A0` longer and
  moving forward to `D1` or `A1`

## Latest Decision After First Valid `D1`

The first valid `D1` run did not change the baseline decision.

Observed outcome:

- `D1` executed correctly end-to-end
- it failed truthfully on proposal quality, not on infrastructure
- it added useful diagnostic signal, especially around weak evidence grounding
  and weak rollback quality
- it did not outperform `A0`

Operational conclusion:

- `A0` remains the baseline that should be protected
- `D1` remains experimental
- the next work should improve the common planner-quality layer before spending
  more effort on reranker-specific routing

## Delivery Hardening Update

`A0.2` is now closed for the two failure-path regressions that mattered most.

Evidence:

- the orchestration engine now ignores duplicate `.failed` and `.escalated`
  results once the task is already terminal
- a dedicated deployed smoke published duplicated
  `payments.incident.fix-planning.escalated` events for the same task
- the live result persisted only one terminal stage event, one
  `status.escalated`, one `escalated.to-human`, and produced `0` DLQ messages
- a second dedicated deployed smoke published duplicated
  `payments.incident.fix-planning.failed` events for the same task
- the live result persisted only one `.failed`, created only one retry task,
  and produced `0` DLQ messages

Implication:

- terminal delivery semantics are now materially cleaner on the validated
  `fix_planning` failure and escalation paths
- the next iteration should focus on widening experiment coverage or moving the
  planner stack forward, not on re-litigating these specific duplicate-delivery
  regressions

## Execution Evidence Update

`A0.3` is now materially implemented.

Evidence:

- deployed smokes can now emit a compact `execution_evidence` block for the
  exact `task_id`
- that block exposes internal sub-attempt count, durations, operations, token
  usage, finish reasons, and failure reasons
- the smoke catalog is now backed by named YAML scenarios
- a live `cache-stampede` run completed truthfully while surfacing four internal
  planner sub-attempts inside one workflow-visible task attempt

Implication:

- one of the most important interpretability gaps in `A0` is now closed
- the next iteration should use this evidence to widen coverage, not just add
  more infrastructure

## Scenario Matrix Update

`A0.4` is now also completed.

Evidence:

- the deployed smoke ran the full YAML scenario catalog in one batch
- `cache-stampede`, `connection-pool-exhaustion`, and `queue-backlog` all ended
  in truthful `.completed`
- all three preserved kernel read-back semantics
- all three completed in `task_attempt = 1`
- all three also completed in `internal_attempt_count = 1`

Implication:

- the current `A0` baseline now has first breadth evidence, not only repeated
  evidence on one fixture
- the next iteration no longer needs to prove that `A0` works across more than
  one scenario family at all
- the next decision is whether to deepen `A0` further or spend the next slice
  on a support-sidecar or stronger planner experiment

## Latest Live Outcome

The latest deployed `A0` smoke materially changed the state of this plan.

Observed live result:

- long-budget `A0` on deployed `PIR` produced a truthful
  `payments.incident.fix-planning.completed`
- `run_status` advanced to `mitigating`
- `task_status` advanced to `completed`
- a real `decision:{incident_id}:fix-planning` node was materialized
- `ADDRESSES` and `BASED_ON` were both confirmed on kernel read-back

Important inference:

- the current `Qwen3.5-9B` planner is not categorically incapable of this task
- the previous dominant blocker was not just reasoning quality
- the earlier live failures were materially influenced by output-budget and
  response-shape constraints

That means the next iteration should not immediately jump to a larger planner.
It should first use the now-improved evidence layer to test breadth.

## Key Decision For The Next Series

The next series should prioritize these changes first:

1. more task-level wall-clock budget
2. more agent iteration retries
3. explicit operational support for long-running stage execution

It should not prioritize these first:

1. prompt reduction
2. token-budget reduction
3. more graph roles
4. aggressive output simplification just to fit the old time envelope

Reason:

- the current evidence says the agent is under-timed, not over-contextualized
- we should first find out what the current local graph path can do when given a
  realistic autonomy budget

Updated reading after `A0.3`:

- budget, retries, delivery hardening, and execution evidence are now all good
  enough to treat `A0` as a real baseline
- the next uncertainty is no longer "what happened inside one run?"
- the next uncertainty is "how broad is the working envelope across incident
  families?"

## Important Operational Constraint

Longer LLM budgets require an accompanying transport decision.

Current `PIR` JetStream consumer configuration uses:

- `AckWait = 5m`

That means a `15-20` minute `fix_planning` budget cannot simply be enabled in
the executor while keeping the current consumer contract unchanged.

One of these must happen in the same iteration series:

1. raise the consumer `AckWait` above the maximum expected stage duration
2. move long-running specialist execution behind a decoupled async worker model

For the next practical slice, the simpler path is:

- keep the current consumer architecture
- raise `AckWait` to match the new stage budget with safety margin

## New Concurrency Constraint From Live Smokes

The latest in-cluster smoke exposed a different class of bottleneck:

- a long-running `payments.incident.*.requested` message can keep the only
  active consumer busy for minutes
- while that happens, a fast terminal event like
  `payments.incident.fix-planning.escalated` from another incident can remain
  pending even though it is already in the stream

This is not primarily an LLM-quality problem.
It is a consumer-topology problem.

Operational reading:

- global FIFO across all incident messages is not acceptable
- FIFO should hold per `incident_run_id`, not across unrelated incidents
- `request` and `result` traffic should not share the same critical lane

Near-term architectural direction:

1. split consumers by event class:
   - `alerts`
   - `stage requests`
   - `stage results`
2. preserve ordering semantics per `incident_run_id`
3. keep stage-result handling on a fast lane so terminal transitions do not sit
   behind old long-running planner work

## `Envoy` Note

`Envoy` is now recorded as a possible later hardening layer for:

- transport retries
- rate limiting and quotas
- circuit breaking
- mTLS normalization across runtime, kernel, and model endpoints

But it is not the next fix for the current live blockage.

Reason:

- `Envoy` can improve transport policy
- it does not solve event-lane contention or global FIFO between incidents

So the intended order remains:

1. fix consumer topology and per-incident ordering first
2. only then consider whether `Envoy` adds enough value to justify its
   operational complexity

## Proposed Policy Revision

### Retry Count

Replace the current provisional policy:

- `max_iterations_per_task = 2`

With a new starting policy:

- `max_iterations_per_task = 4`

Interpretation:

- one primary attempt
- up to three bounded retries before escalation

This is intentionally more permissive because the objective is now to give the
planner a real opportunity, not just a quick structured-output check.

### Task Wall-Clock Budget

Replace the current `45s` task budget with:

- `fix_planning total task wall-clock budget <= 20m`

This should be treated as the working baseline for the next series, not as the
final forever value.

### Proposed Phase Budget Baseline

Initial long-budget policy:

- runtime/session setup: `<= 30s`
- graph read and local detail fetch: `<= 30s`
- publish + read-back: `<= 2m`
- remaining budget reserved for planning attempts: `~17m`

Proposed attempt-level budget:

- attempt 1: `<= 4m`
- attempt 2: `<= 4m`
- attempt 3: `<= 4m`
- attempt 4: `<= 4m`

This gives:

- enough time for a real planner response
- enough room for multiple tries
- explicit reserve for publish/read-back and operational slack

### In-Attempt Budget Shape

Do not optimize this too aggressively yet.

For the next slice, the in-attempt policy should be generous:

- primary planner generation gets the majority of the attempt budget
- repair remains available, but should not starve generation
- judge should remain bounded and may be moved to advisory mode if it becomes a
  secondary bottleneck

The main rule is:

- do not keep an `8s` first-generation budget when the system claims to support
  autonomous production mitigation

## Role And Model Strategy

### Roles

Roles are not the first lever for this series.

Current live evidence showed that:

- `incident-commander`
- `fix-planning-agent`

returned essentially the same bundle in the failed-state graph.

So the next slice should not spend time inventing more read roles unless live
evidence later shows meaningful graph-shape divergence.

### Models

Model separation is valuable, but only after the long-budget baseline exists.

Recommended progression:

1. first prove the current planner with a realistic time and retry budget
2. only then add fallback model routing if needed

If a later iteration needs multi-model support, the recommended split is:

- primary planner model: strongest reasoning model, long budget
- repair/jsonizer model: smaller, faster, structure-focused model
- judge model: smaller or medium model, safety/grounding focused
- optional fallback planner: alternate strong model or deployment

This is materially more useful than adding more graph roles right now.

## Theoretical Fit By Model Type

For this use case, not all "helper models" solve the same problem.

The practical split is:

1. planner models

- generative causal LMs
- appropriate for:
  - understanding incident context
  - generating remediation hypotheses
  - producing a candidate mitigation plan
- these are the models that should receive the long budget

2. repair / jsonizer models

- generative models, usually smaller
- appropriate for:
  - converting a candidate plan into strict JSON
  - repairing malformed but semantically useful output
- these do not replace the planner; they reduce structure fragility

3. reward / judge models

- usually classification-style models rather than chat-completion models
- appropriate for:
  - scoring a completed candidate
  - ranking multiple candidate plans
  - gating acceptance offline or in a sidecar step
- important limitation:
  - many are not drop-in replacements for `OpenAI Chat Completions`
  - they often require sequence-classification style integration

4. rerankers

- ranking models, not planners
- appropriate for:
  - ranking candidate evidence chunks
  - ranking candidate retrieval outputs
  - ranking multiple remediation candidates after generation
- they should not be treated as mitigation planners

5. coder models

- generative code-specialized LMs
- appropriate for:
  - the later `patch_application` stage
  - code diffs, patch suggestions, and implementation review
- they are not the first model to optimize for the current `fix_planning`
  bottleneck

### What This Means For Our Use Case

Immediate takeaway:

- the next `fix_planning` iteration should still be planner-first
- the best model candidates to test after budget expansion are:
  - `Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507`
  - `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B`
  - `mistralai/Mistral-Small-3.2-24B-Instruct-2506`

Best support-model candidates after that:

- repair/jsonizer: `Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507`
- reranker: `Qwen/Qwen3-Reranker-0.6B` or `Qwen/Qwen3-Reranker-4B`
- reward/judge sidecar: `Skywork/Skywork-Reward-V2-Qwen3-8B`

Important practical conclusion:

- reward and reranker models are useful support components
- they are not substitutes for giving the planner enough time
- coder models belong to the next stage family, not the current planner bottleneck

## Iteration Series

### Iteration A: Long-Budget Single-Model Baseline

Goal:

- prove that `fix_planning` can use a serious wall-clock budget on the existing
  single-model path

Changes:

- raise `fix_planning` task budget to `20m`
- raise retries to `4`
- raise smoke timeout above the task budget
- raise JetStream `AckWait` with safety margin
- add per-attempt timing and outcome logging

Do not change yet:

- prompt structure
- token budget
- graph read shape
- model routing

Exit condition:

- one live smoke completes successfully, or
- one live smoke exhausts the full long-budget policy and escalates truthfully
  with clear per-attempt evidence

### Iteration A1: Observability And Repeatability

Trigger for this iteration:

- `A0` has already produced at least one truthful live `.completed`

Goal:

- convert one successful live smoke into a measurable, repeatable operating
  baseline for the current deployment

Required changes:

1. expose first-class LLM observability for:
   - `prompt_tokens`
   - `completion_tokens`
   - `finish_reason`
   - per-operation call count
   - per-operation latency
2. keep raw `llm_traces` as forensic evidence, but do not rely on them as the
   only observability surface
3. run repeated live smokes against the same deployed `A0` configuration and
   capture them with the same ficha
4. preserve the successful `generate` token ceiling and thinking-mode split that
   produced the first live completion

Why this now matters:

- one `.completed` proves feasibility
- it does not yet prove stability
- we cannot judge whether to stay on `Qwen3.5-9B` or move to `A1-A3` without
  seeing token usage, finish reasons, and repeatability patterns across runs

Exit condition:

- `3/5` consecutive truthful live smokes are captured for the deployed `A0`
  configuration, with token and finish-reason observability available for every
  LLM call

Current status:

- completed on the `2026-04-12` live sample
- first-class LLM observability is live
- deployed `A0` achieved `5/5` truthful `.completed` smokes with valid
  read-back in the first repeatability pass

### Iteration A2: Failure-Path Idempotency

Trigger for this iteration:

- any failure path still causes redelivery or invalid terminal state transitions

Goal:

- make `.failed` / `.escalated` terminal handling idempotent and operationally
  quiet

Required changes:

- stop `.escalated -> escalated` reconsumption from reaching DLQ
- make terminal stage-result handling safe under duplicate delivery

This is still part of the `A0` hardening series because truthful failure is a
core property of the first real agent.

### Iteration B: Fallback Model Expansion

Trigger for this iteration:

- only if Iteration A still fails after the model has been given a real time
  budget

Goal:

- preserve the same graph-local agent path, but allow alternate model help

Candidate policy:

- attempt 1-2: primary planner model
- attempt 3: alternate planner model or deployment
- attempt 4: final bounded retry with full prior rejection context

The point is not to add more reasoning layers. The point is to reduce single
deployment fragility.

### Iteration C: Structured Multi-Model Specialization

Trigger for this iteration:

- only if fallback routing still leaves reliability problems

Goal:

- separate heavy planning from structure repair and judgment

Candidate split:

- planner: long-budget reasoning
- repair/jsonizer: fast structured output repair
- judge: bounded acceptance review

This should happen only after the main planner has already been given enough
time. Otherwise we will still be optimizing the wrong bottleneck.

### Iteration D: Role Differentiation Only If Needed

Trigger for this iteration:

- only if live evidence shows that role-specific graph retrieval materially
  changes planner quality

Until then:

- keep the current `fix-planning-agent` role
- avoid role proliferation without evidence

## Required PIR Changes For Iteration A

Minimum implementation set:

1. raise `fix_planning` stage execution budget to the new long-budget baseline
2. raise `fix_planning` retry count to `4`
3. rebalance attempt reservation logic around the longer wall-clock budget
4. raise smoke default timeout above the new task budget
5. raise JetStream consumer `AckWait` above the new task budget
6. log per-attempt:
   - start time
   - end time
   - duration
   - failure class
   - rejection reason
   - model used
7. keep truthful completion / escalation semantics unchanged

## Required PIR Changes For Iteration A1

Minimum implementation set:

1. expose `llm_calls_total`
2. expose `llm_prompt_tokens_total`
3. expose `llm_completion_tokens_total`
4. expose `llm_finish_reason_total`
5. expose LLM latency by operation and model
6. include `operation`, `model`, and `stage` labels at minimum
7. document how these metrics map back to the `fix_planning` planner, repair,
   and judge calls
8. keep `llm_traces` as the source of truth for forensic payload inspection

## Required PIR Changes For Iteration A2

Minimum implementation set:

1. make terminal stage-result application idempotent
2. prevent duplicate `.escalated` deliveries from creating invalid
   `escalated -> escalated` transitions
3. keep the smoke harness terminal-outcome aware

## Success Criteria For This Series

This series is successful when all of these become true:

- `fix_planning` gets a real autonomy budget in live execution
- the system can tolerate a long-running stage without transport-level
  redelivery fighting the executor
- retries are numerous enough to be operationally meaningful
- truthful escalation remains intact when the planner still cannot complete
- one live completion is followed by observable and repeatable behavior, not
  just a one-off success
- the next evidence report shows either:
  - repeated real `.completed` decision waves with kernel read-back and LLM
    observability, or
  - a full multi-attempt failure with enough time spent to justify escalation

## Explicit Non-Goals

For this next series, do not frame the work as:

- “make it faster at any cost”
- “fit the planner into the old 45s envelope”
- “shrink context first”
- “cut prompt or token budget first”

Those may become later optimizations, but not before the agent has had a fair
chance to succeed.

## Recommended Immediate Next Step

Implement Iteration A first:

- longer task budget
- more retries
- longer consumer ack window
- longer smoke timeout

Then run a new live smoke and write a fresh evidence report against that policy
before deciding whether fallback-model routing is actually necessary.
